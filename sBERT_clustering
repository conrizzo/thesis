Cluster 9, #46 Elements 
	 Methods: We searched the PubMed for case-control studies in English, published between Jan 1 and Apr 22, 2020, that had data on diabetes in patients with COVID-19.
	 OBJECTIVE Diabetes is common in COVID-19 patients and associated with unfavorable outcomes.
	 We also determined the pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19.
	 Older patients with diabetes were prone to death related to COVID-19.
	 Interpretation Overall risks of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were substantially elevated in those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared with the background population.
	 Diabetes has rapidly emerged as a major comorbidity for COVID-19 severity.
	 The risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, and therefore the need for special protective measures, varies widely among those with diabetes but can be predicted reasonably well using previous clinical history.
	 Notably, in several studies, diabetes is one of the most reported comorbidities in patients with severe COVID-19.
	 Increased COVID-19-related mortality was associated not only with cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes but, independently, also with glycaemic control and BMI.
	 We sought to review and analyze the data regarding the association between diabetes and COVID-19, pathophysiology of the disease in diabetes and management of patients with diabetes who develop COVID-19 infection.
	 Background and aims: Diabetes mellitus is associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.
	 Conclusions: Pre-existing diabetes is significantly associated with greater risk of severe/critical illness and in-hospital mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19.
	 The pooled prevalence of diabetes in patients with COVID-19 was 9.8% (95% CI: 8.7%-10.9%) (after adjusting for heterogeneity).
	 Objective This study explores the clinical characteristics of patients with diabetes with severe covid-19, and the association of diabetes with survival duration in patients with severe covid-19.
	 Aims: To estimate the prevalence of established diabetes and its association with the clinical severity and in-hospital mortality associated with COVID-19.
	 Conclusions/interpretations In people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19.
	 Conclusions: The two-way interaction between COVID-19 and diabetes mellitus sets up a vicious cycle wherein COVID-19 leads to worsening of dysglycemia and diabetes mellitus, in turn, exacerbates the severity of COVID-19.
	 Pre-existing diabetes was associated with an approximate twofold higher risk of having severe/critical COVID-19 illness (n = 22 studies; random-effects odds ratio 2.10, 95% CI 1.71-2.57; I-2 = 41.5%) and similar to threefold increased risk of in-hospital mortality (n = 15 studies; random-effects odds ratio 2.68, 95% CI 2.09-3.4 4; I-2 = 46.7%).
	 Results: We included 33 studies (16,003 patients) and found diabetes to be significantly associated with mortality of COVID-19 with a pooled odds ratio of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.37-2.64; p < 0.01).
	 Conclusions: Suggestions are made on the possible pathophysiological mechanisms of the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19, and its management.
	 Background: Many studies on COVID-19 have reported diabetes to be associated with severe disease and mortality, however, the data is conflicting.
	 We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes and to analyze the risk factors for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients with diabetes.
	 48 patients with severe covid-19 had diabetes, and 145 patients (ie, the controls) did not have diabetes.
	 Conclusion The mortality rate in patients with severe covid-19 with diabetes is considerable.
	 Confirmed COVID-19 patients with diabetes (N= 153) who were discharged or died from 1 January 2020 to 8 March 2020 were identified.
	 We assessed associations between risk factors and COVID-19-related mortality in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.
	 We hope to highlight gaps in knowledge that require further studies pertinent to COVID-19 in patients with diabetes.
	 Background and aims: High prevalence of diabetes makes it an important comorbidity in patients with COVID-19.
	 Recent clinical studies show a strong association with COVID-19 and diabetes.
	 Among people with diabetes, adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes duration and type, those who developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were more likely to be male, live in residential care or a more deprived area, have a COVID-19 risk condition, retinopathy, reduced renal fimction, or worse glycaemic control, have had a diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia hospitalisation in the past 5 years, be on more anti-diabetic and other medication (all p<0.0001), and have been a smoker (p=0.0011).
	 Background Although diabetes has been associated with COVID-19-related mortality, the absolute and relative risks for type 1 and type 2 diabetes are unknown.
	 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this retrospective study involving 904 patients with COVID-19 (136 with diabetes, mostly type 2 diabetes), clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared between the group with diabetes and the group without diabetes, and between groups taking different medications.
	 We assessed the independent effects of diabetes status, by type, on in hospital death in England in patients with COVID-19 during the period from March 1 to May 11, 2020.
	 RESULTS The proportion of comorbid diabetes is similar between cases of confirmed and of clinically diagnosed COVID-19.
	 Conclusions: Diabetes in patients with COVID-19 is associated with a two-fold increase in mortality as well as severity of COVID-19, as compared to non-diabetics.
	 Results: There is evidence of increased incidence and severity of COVID-19 in patients with diabetes.
	 CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 patients with diabetes had worse outcomes compared with the sex- and age-matched patients without diabetes.
	 OBJECTIVE Diabetes is one of the most distinct comorbidities of COVID-19.
	 Methods We conducted a nationwide multicentre observational study in people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 in 53 ench centres in the period 10-31 March 2020.
	 Compared with patients with severe covid-19 without diabetes, patients with diabetes were older, susceptible to receiving mechanical ventilation and admission to ICU, and had higher mortality.
	 Background Diabetes has been associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality, but the association between modifiable risk factors, including hyperglycaemia and obesity, and COVID-19-related mortality among people with diabetes is unclear.
	 For people with diabetes, we obtained data on potential risk factors for fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 from the national diabetes register and other linked health administrative databases.
	 Conclusions Our data support the notion that diabetes should be considered as a risk factor for a rapid progression and bad prognosis of COVID-19.

	 Human angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) has been identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2.
	 The entry of SARS-CoV-2 into its target cells depends on binding between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein and its cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)(2,4-6).
	 SARS-CoV-2 shares both high sequence similarity and the use of the same cell entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
	 This systemic involvement is postulated to be mainly related to the SARS-CoV-2 virus binding on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors located on several different human cells.
	 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into target cells.ACE2has been proposed as an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG).
	 By engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or Ace2), the novel pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades host cells and affects many organs, including the brain.
	 The angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) has been identified as the receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 viral entry.
	 Its pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, has been shown to use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its host cell receptor, same as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003.
	 This is related to the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, and expression of ACE2 in the lung, cardiovascular system, kidney, and other tissues.
	 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), is the main entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2; although dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) might also act as a binding target.
	 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cell-entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)(2).
	 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been established as the functional host receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for the current devastating worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
	 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the key host cellular receptor of SARS-CoV-2, has been identified in multiple organs, but its cellular distribution in human heart is not illuminated clearly.
	 Indeed, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed on differentiated enterocytes.
	 As an essential step during infection, SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein to engage with the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on host cells(1,2).
	 It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 utilizes angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as host receptor and host proteases for cell surface binding and internalization.
	 Recently it was shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, binds to the human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
	 However, the responsible virus - SARS-CoV-2 - gains entry to host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), highlighting the need to understand the relationship between the virus and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and how this might be affected by RAS inhibitors.
	 The SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor as a prelude to viral entry into the cell.
	 Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (EC:3.4.17.23) is a transmembrane protein which is considered as a receptor for spike protein binding of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2).
	 SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is characterized by viral spike protein interaction with cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and serine protease TMPRSS2.
	 Aims The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for cell entry.
	 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is not only an enzyme but also a functional receptor on cell surfaces through which SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cells and is highly expressed in the heart, kidneys, and lungs and shed into the plasma.
	 In particular, activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is dysregulated in cardiovascular disease, and this enzyme is used by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to initiate the infection.
	 SARS-CoV-2 cannot infect wild-type laboratory mice owing to inefficient interactions between the viral spike protein and the mouse orthologue of the human receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)(4).
	 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV-2, mediates the virus infection by binding to spike protein.
	 Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV enter host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in various human organs.
	 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is expressed in human vascular endothelium, respiratory epithelium, and other cell types, and is thought to be a primary mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry and infection.
	 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that is causing the serious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.
	 This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic.
	 SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein binds angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and in concert with host proteases, principally transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), promotes cellular entry.
	 The mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection is the requisite binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and internalization of the complex by the host cell.
	 Early evidence pointed to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor.
	 SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recognize the same receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-in humans(3,4).
	 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects human cells binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an enzyme responsible for the cleavage of angiotensin II into angiotensin 1-7, which has vasodilating and anti-inflammatory effects.
	 The novel 2019 SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell by binding of the viral surface spike glycoprotein (S-protein) to cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.
	 The main receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is now undergoing extensive scrutiny to understand the routes of transmission and sensitivity in different species.
	 SARS-CoV-2, which is the virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor to invade human cells.
	 Here, we identified the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2 S protein and found that the RBD protein bound strongly to human and bat angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors.
	 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus enters host cells via an interaction between its Spike protein and the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
	 Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host target cells.
	 The SARS-CoV-2 virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) present on brain endothelial and smooth muscle cells.

	 As per the flexible approach in the current COVID-19 pandemic authors recommend mass administration of vitamin D supplements to population at risk for COVID-19.
	 The focus of this article is to apply our current understanding of vitamin D as a facilitator of immunocompetence both with regard to innate and adaptive immunity and to consider how this may relate to COVID-19 disease.
	 The main outcome was the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in severe cases of COVID-19.
	 Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study between 1 March and 30 April 2020 to assess the importance of vitamin D deficiency in older patients with COVID-19.
	 The present aim was to propose an hypothesis that there is a potential association between mean levels of vitamin D in various countries with cases and mortality caused by COVID-19.
	 The findings do not support the use of a high dose of vitamin D-3 for treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19.
	 Vitamin D had recently been reviewed as one of the factors that may affect the severity in COVID-19.
	 Conclusions: Our findings do not support a potential link between vitamin D concentrations and risk of COVID-19 infection, nor that vitamin D concentration may explain ethnic differences in COVID-19 infection.
	 It should be advisable to perform dedicated studies about vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients with different degrees of disease severity.
	 In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we analyze the association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity, via an analysis of the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in people with the disease.
	 Severe vitamin D deficiency (based on a cut-off of <10 ng/dl) was found in 24.0% of the patients in the COVID-19 group and 7.3% in the control group.
	 Vitamin D deficiency was not associated with a higher chance of infection by COVID-19 (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 0.80-1.88), but we identified that severe cases of COVID-19 present 64% (OR = 1.64; 95% CI = 1.30-2.09) more vitamin D deficiency compared with mild cases.
	 Meaning These findings appear to support a role of vitamin D status in COVID-19 risk; randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether broad population interventions and interventions among groups at increased risk of vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 could reduce COVID-19 incidence.
	 This review discussed the possible roles of vitamin D in reducing the risk of COVID-19 and other acute respiratory tract infections and severity.
	 This all translates into increased mortality in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients.
	 There is still limited evidence regarding the influence of vitamin D in people with COVID-19.
	 Objective To examine whether the last vitamin D status before COVID-19 testing is associated with COVID-19 test results.
	 Some retrospective studies demonstrated a correlation between vitamin D status and COVID-19 severity and mortality, while other studies did not find the correlation when confounding variables are adjusted.
	 Negative correlations between mean levels of vitamin D (average 56 mmol/L, STDEV 10.61) in each country and the number of COVID-19 cases/1 M (mean 295.95, STDEV 298.7, and mortality/1 M (mean 5.96, STDEV 15.13) were observed.
	 Moreover, cardiac and coagulopathic features of COVID-19 disease deserve attention as they may also be related to vitamin D. Finally, we review the current clinical data associating vitamin D with SARS-CoV-2 infection, a putative clinical link that at this time must still be considered hypothetical.
	 The objective of current study is to analyze the vitamin D level in COVID-19 patients and its impact on the disease severity.
	 Conclusions Substantial evidence supports a link between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 severity but it is all indirect.
	 The mean levels of vitamin D for 20 European countries and morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19 were acquired.
	 Our findings provide impetus to explore the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.
	 Evidence supporting the role of vitamin D in reducing risk of COVID-19 includes that the outbreak occurred in winter, a time when 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations are lowest; that the number of cases in the Southern Hemisphere near the end of summer are low; that vitamin D deficiency has been found to contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome; and that case-fatality rates increase with age and with chronic disease comorbidity, both of which are associated with lower 25(OH)D concentration.
	 Vitamin D was associated with COVID-19 infection univariably (OR = 0.99; 95% CI 0.99-0.999; p = 0.013), but not after adjustment for confounders (OR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.998-1.01; p = 0.208).
	 Conclusions and Relevance In this single-center, retrospective cohort study, likely deficient vitamin D status was associated with increased COVID-19 risk, a finding that suggests that randomized trials may be needed to determine whether vitamin D affects COVID-19 risk.
	 In conclusion, there is not enough evidence on the association between vitamin D levels and COVID-19 severity and mortality.
	 Vitamin D level is markedly low in severe COVID-19 patients.
	 The COVID-19 group showed significantly lower vitamin D values than the healthy control group (150 people, matched by age/ sex).
	 Conclusion Therefore, it is recommended that improving vitamin D status in the general population and in particular hospitalized patients has a potential benefit in reducing the severity of morbidities and mortality associated with acquiring COVID-19.
	 Inflammatory response is high in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients.
	 Whether vitamin D is associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence is unknown.
	 Moreover, this study determined the correlation of vitamin D levels with COVID-19 cases and deaths in 20 European countries as of 20 May 2020.
	 Objectives To review the evidence relevant to vitamin D and COVID-19.

	 An effective vaccine is needed to halt the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.
	 There is an urgent need for a safe and protective vaccine to control the global spread of SARS-CoV-2 and prevent COVID-19.
	 Rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 variants may jeopardize newly introduced antibody and vaccine countermeasures.
	 Extensive efforts are underway to find specific vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
	 SARS-CoV-2 vaccination still reduces new infections, but effectiveness and attenuation of peak viral burden are reduced with B.1.617.2.
	 Lastly, potentials candidates for the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been described.
	 Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines might require greater immunogenicity and durability than natural infection to drive long-term protection.
	 The new vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are novel in terms of specificity, their wide dissemination across the global population and the inclusion of newly licensed mRNA platforms.
	 BACKGROUND The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019 and spread globally, prompting an international effort to accelerate development of a vaccine.
	 Currently, considerable efforts have been put into developing effective and safe drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
	 Development of a wider range of vaccines, with different mechanisms of action, could help control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 globally.
	 We believe this review will increase our understanding of the vaccine designing against SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently contribute to the control of SARS-CoV-2 infections.
	 The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has led to the development of various vaccines.
	 In addition to reviewing the different stages of vaccine development, vaccine platforms and vaccine candidates, this review also discusses the biological and immunological basis required of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the importance of a collaborative international effort, the ethical implications of vaccine development, the efficacy needed for an immunogenic vaccine, vaccine coverage, the potential limitations and challenges of vaccine development.
	 A candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 might act against infection, disease, or transmission, and a vaccine capable of reducing any of these elements could contribute to disease control.
	 Here, we discuss the immunopathological basis of vaccine designing that can be approached for vaccine development against SARS-CoV-2 infection and different platforms that are being used for vaccine development.
	 Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines will be essential to reducing morbidity and mortality if the virus establishes itself in the population.
	 This paper reviews the virology and immunology of SARS-CoV-2, alternative therapies for COVID-19 to vaccination, principles and design considerations in COVID-19 vaccine development, and the promises and roles of vaccine carriers in addressing the unique immunopathological challenges presented by the disease.
	 Therefore, rapid development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are urgently needed.
	 Various platforms for vaccine development are available namely: virus vectored vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, genetic vaccines, and monoclonal antibodies for passive immunization which are under evaluations for SARS-CoV-2, with each having discrete benefits and hindrances.
	 The race to produce vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began when the first sequence was published, and this forms the basis for vaccines currently deployed globally.
	 These data demonstrate vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 clinical disease.
	 At least 120 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are under development.
	 In the eleven months elapsed since the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its genome, an exceptional effort by the scientific community has led to the development of over 300 vaccine projects.
	 This urgent situation is pressing the world to respond with the development of novel vaccine or a small molecule therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2.
	 As SARS-CoV-2 has been circulating for over a year, dozens of vaccine candidates are under development or in clinical use.
	 Background: A vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 is of high urgency.
	 Here I review the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
	 Although novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for the pandemic, success is highly contingent on the precise vaccine properties and population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored.
	 These findings have implications for vaccine protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.
	 The spread of the SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic within a few months of onset motivates the development of a rapidly scalable vaccine.
	 In this review, we provide an overview of the experimental and clinical data obtained from recent SARS-CoV-2 vaccines trials, and highlight certain potential safety issues that require consideration when developing vaccines.
	 As the world races to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, Dai and Gao highlight which viral targets are best to include in a vaccine and how this impacts the induced immune response and, ultimately, the safety and efficacy of a vaccine.
	 This work aims to share strategies and candidate antigens to develop safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

	 Alongside investigations into the virology of SARS-CoV-2, understanding the fundamental physiological and immunological processes underlying the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is vital for the identification and rational design of effective therapies.
	 Mechanisms of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease and mitigation strategies for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapies are discussed.
	 Currently very little is known about how our immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
	 The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is known to involve all the components of the immune system that together appear responsible for viral elimination and recovery from the infection.
	 The effectual host immune response including innate and adaptive immunity against SARS-Cov-2 seems crucial to control and resolve the viral infection.
	 The immune system of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 is severely impaired.
	 Moreover, rational management of the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which includes enhancing anti-viral immunity while inhibiting systemic inflammation, may be key to successful treatment.
	 Understanding the antibody response directed against SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for the development of vaccine, therapeutic, and public health interventions.
	 Nevertheless, it is important to generate knowledge on SARS-CoV-2 mechanisms of infection and its impact on host immunity, to guide the design of COVID-19 specific therapeutics and vaccines suitable for mass immunization.
	 Our work provides a basis for further analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19, especially in the severe cases.
	 The immune response to SARS-CoV-2 is critical in controlling disease, but there is concern that waning immunity may predispose to reinfection.
	 We still know very little about how the human immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2.
	 The durability of infection-induced SARS-CoV-2 immunity has major implications for reinfection and vaccine development.
	 Here, we studied humoral and cellular immune responses to wild type SARS-CoV-2 and the B.1.1.7 and B.
	 SARS-CoV-2 canmutate and evade immunity, with consequences for efficacy of emerging vaccines and antibody therapeutics.
	 Our work provides detailed information for the assays used, facilitating further and longitudinal analysis of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
	 Herein, the host immune responses against SARS-CoV discussed in this review provide implications for developing NAbs and understanding clinical interventions against SARS-CoV-2.
	 Current evidence suggests that severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with a dys-regulated immune response.
	 Understanding the immune responses elicited by SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical in terms of protection against reinfection and, thus, for public health policy and vaccine development for COVID-19.
	 Our review shows that SARS-Cov-2 selectively induces a high level of IL-6 and results in the exhaustion of lymphocytes.
	 Nevertheless, recent studies have highlighted various aspects of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that are starting to enable some general concepts to emerge.
	 The landscape of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.
	 The contribution of T cells to the SARS-CoV-2 response remains an important and unresolved question.
	 Altogether, our results contribute to our understanding of the immune correlates of SARS-CoV-2-induced disease, and rapid evaluation of the role of the humoral response in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.
	 This study improves our understanding of immune response in humans after SARS-CoV-2 infection.
	 Much remains to be learned about the immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
	 Knowledge is now available on relationships between antigen-specific immune responses and SARS-CoV-2 infection.
	 However, little is known about how the innate immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2.
	 These findings have implications for understanding protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2, therapeutic use of immune plasma, and development of much-needed vaccines.
	 Understanding immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV2 and the resulting delayed massive immune response will result in the identification of biomarkers that predict outcomes as well as phenotype and disease stage specific treatments that will likely include both antiviral and immune modulating agents.

	 Findings In this case series study of 187 patients with COVID-19, 27.8% of patients had myocardial injury, which resulted in cardiac dysfunction and arrhythmias.
	 Objective To explore the association between cardiac injury and mortality in patients with COVID-19.
	 Myocardial injury has a significant association with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury were relatively favorable.
	 OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to describe the degree of myocardial injury and associated outcomes in a large hospitalized cohort with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.
	 At least 8.0% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury.
	 We show that, beyond the first 30 d after infection, individuals with COVID-19 are at increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease spanning several categories, including cerebrovascular disorders, dysrhythmias, ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, heart failure and thromboembolic disease.
	 We hereby review the peer-reviewed and pre-print reports pertaining to cardiovascular considerations related to COVID-19 and highlight gaps in knowledge that require further study pertinent to patients, health care workers, and health systems.
	 Individuals with COVID-19 are at increased long-term risk for a wide range of cardiovascular disorders, even for individuals who were not hospitalized during the acute phase of the infection.
	 We are discovering patients with COVID-19 are at increased risk of acute cardiac injury.
	 Background and aims: Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have underlying cardiovascular (CV) disease or develop acute cardiac injury during the course of the illness.
	 Among patients with COVID-19, there is a high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, and >7% of patients experience myocardial injury from the infection (22% of critically ill patients).
	 The cardiac injury is a common condition among the hospitalized patients with COVID-19.
	 Case reports of hospitalized patients suggest that COVID-19 prominently affects the cardiovascular system, but the overall impact remains unknown.
	 Among patients with COVID-19, underlying cardiovascular comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes and especially cardiovascular disease, has been associated with adverse outcomes, whereas the emergence of cardiovascular complications, including myocardial injury, heart failure and arrhythmias, has been associated with poor survival.
	 Pre-existing cardiovascular disease seems to be linked with worse outcomes and increased risk of death in patients with COVID-19, whereas COVID-19 itself can also induce myocardial injury, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism.
	 Furthermore, COVID-19 contributes to cardiovascular complications, including acute myocardial injury as a result of acute coronary syndrome, myocarditis, stress-cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock, and cardiac arrest.
	 BACKGROUND Myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 was previously reported in hospitalized patients.
	 Objective: This brief report evaluates cardiovascular complications in the setting of COVID-19 infection.
	 Question What is the incidence and significance of cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19?
	 Myocardial injury is one of the important pathogenic features of COVID-19.
	 Objective To evaluate the association of underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury with fatal outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
	 Conclusions and Relevance Myocardial injury is significantly associated with fatal outcome of COVID-19, while the prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury is relatively favorable.
	 Findings In this cohort study of 416 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19, cardiac injury occurred in 19.7% of patients during hospitalization, and it was one independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality.
	 Cardiac injury is a prevalent complication of severe patients, exacerbating the disease severity in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.
	 Therefore, we focused on the condition of the heart, and sought to provide firsthand evidence for whethermyocarditis and myocardial injury were caused by COVID-19.
	 Conclusion COVID-19 patients may develop severe cardiac complications such as myocarditis and heart failure.
	 Conclusions: Hospitalized patients with concomitant cardiac disease and COVID-19 have an extremely poor prognosis compared with subjects without a history of cardiac disease, with higher mortality, thrombo-embolic events, and septic shock rates.
	 This brief review explores the available evidence regarding the association between COVID-19 and myocardial injury.
	 Because many COVID-19 patients have cardiovascular comorbidities, myocardial infarction should be considered.
	 Acute cardiac injury in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is associated with higher morbidity and mortality.

	 Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a high degree of genetic similarity and bind to the same host cell ACE2 receptor.
	 There is good evidence that ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and high expression ofACE2may increase susceptibility to infection.
	 The data presented in this study suggest a higher affinity of the SARS-Cov-2 spike protein to the human ACE2 receptor, compared to the one of Bat-CoV spike and ACE2.
	 ACE2 is activated and down-regulated by the spike protein of the virus and allows the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 into epithelial cells and myocardium.
	 Analysis of ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggests that ACE2 is not only a receptor but is also involved in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication.
	 Recently, ACE2 was identified as the receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the coronavirus that is causing the pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
	 SARS-CoV-2 utilizes ACE-2 receptors found at the surface of the host cells to get inside the cell.
	 Here, we provide a critical summary of the current knowledge highlighting the limitations and remaining gaps that need to be addressed to fully characterize ACE2 function in SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated pathogenesis.
	 ACE2 has now also been identified as a key receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and it has been proposed that inhibiting this interaction might be used in treating patients with COVID-19.
	 Recently, ACE2 was reported as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2.
	 It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may use ACE2 as a receptor to gain entry into human cells, in a way similar to that of SARS-CoV.
	 Conclusions: ACE2, the gene encoding the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is expressed in the human airway epithelium, with variations in expression relevant to the biology of initial steps in SARS-CoV-2 infection.
	 SARS-CoV-2 was reported to enter cells via binding to ACE2, followed by its priming by TMPRSS2.
	 (Cell) identify ACE2 as a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, and the latter show its entry mechanism depends on cellular serine protease TMPRSS2.
	 This study provides new insights into the role of ACE2 in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
	 Human ACE2 is now established as a receptor for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.
	 ACE2 is the receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
	 The initial mechanism for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is the binding of the virus to the membrane-bound form of ACE2, which is mainly expressed in the lung.
	 This study is to investigate the ACE2 expression in various human tissues in order to provide insights into the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
	 Thus, ACE2 is the key to understanding the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
	 Although the role of ACE2 as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 is clear, studies have shown that ACE2 expression is extremely low in various human tissues, especially in the respiratory tract.
	 SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV.
	 Since SARS-CoV-2 must bind with ACE2 before entering the host cells in humans, the distribution and expression of ACE2 may be critical for the target organ of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
	 The cell subsets targeted by SARS-CoV-2 in host tissues and the factors that regulate ACE2 expression remain unknown.
	 Therefore, ACE2 expression may have paradoxical effects, aiding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, yet conversely limiting viral infection.
