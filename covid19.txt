COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 capable of causing mild to severe 
infections in humans. Since its first appearance in China in December 2019, the 
pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world. Despite considerable efforts 
made to contain the disease, the virus has continued its prevalence in many 
countries with varying degrees of clinical manifestations. To contain this 
pandemic, collaborative approach involving accurate diagnosis, epidemiology, 
surveillance, and prophylaxis is essential. However, proper diagnosis using 
rapid technologies plays a crucial role. With increasing incidence of COVID-19 
cases, the accurate and early detection of the SARS-CoV-2 is need of the hour 
for effective prevention and management of COVID-19 cases as well as to curb its 
spread. RT-qPCR assay is considered to be the gold standard for the early 
detection of virus, but this protocol has limited application to use as bedside 
test because of its technical complexity. To address these challenges, several 
POC assays have been developed to facilitate the COVID-19 diagnosis outside the 
centralized testing laboratories as well to accelerate the clinical decision 
making with a least turnaround time. Hence, in this report, we review different 
nucleic acid-based and serological techniques available for the diagnosis and 
effective prevention of COVID-19. KEY POINTS : • Provides comprehensive 
information on the different diagnostic tools available for COVID-19 • Nucleic 
acid based tests or antigen detection tests are used for diagnostic purpose • 
Accurate diagnosis is essential for the efficient management of COVID-19.

A fast and accurate self-testing tool for COVID-19 diagnosis has become a 
prerequisite to comprehend the exact number of cases worldwide and to take 
medical and governmental actions accordingly. SARS-CoV-2 (formerly, 2019-nCoV) 
infection was first reported in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, and then it has 
rapidly spread around the world, causing ~14 million active cases with ~582,000 
deaths as of July 2020. The diagnosis tools available so far have been based on 
a) viral gene detection, b) human antibody detection, and c) viral antigen 
detection, among which the viral gene detection by RT-PCR has been found as the 
most reliable technique. In this report, the current SARS-CoV-2 detection kits, 
exclusively the ones that were issued an "Emergency Use Authorization" from the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, were discussed. The key structural components 
of the virus were presented to provide the audience with an understanding of the 
scientific principles behind the testing tools. The methods that are still in 
the early research state were also reviewed in a subsection based on the reports 
available so far.

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has made a serious public 
health threat worldwide with millions of people at risk in a growing number of 
countries. Though there are no clinically approved antiviral drugs and vaccines 
for COVID-19, attempts are ongoing for clinical trials of several known 
antiviral drugs, their combination, as well as development of vaccines in 
patients with confirmed COVID-19. This review focuses on the latest approaches 
to diagnostics and therapy of COVID-19. We have summarized recent progress on 
the conventional therapeutics such as antiviral drugs, vaccines, anti-SARS-CoV-2 
antibody treatments, and convalescent plasma therapy which are currently under 
extensive research and clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. The 
developments of nanoparticle-based therapeutic and diagnostic approaches have 
been also discussed for COVID-19. We have assessed recent literature data on 
this topic and made a summary of current development and future perspectives.

Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)-based tests are widely used to 
diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As a result that these tests 
cannot be done in local clinics where RT-qPCR testing capability is lacking, 
rapid antigen tests (RATs) for COVID-19 based on lateral flow immunoassays are 
used for rapid diagnosis. However, their sensitivity compared with each other 
and with RT-qPCR and infectious virus isolation has not been examined. Here, we 
compared the sensitivity among four RATs by using severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates and several types of COVID-19 
patient specimens and compared their sensitivity with that of RT-qPCR and 
infectious virus isolation. Although the RATs read the samples containing large 
amounts of virus as positive, even the most sensitive RAT read the samples 
containing small amounts of virus as negative. Moreover, all RATs tested failed 
to detect viral antigens in several specimens from which the virus was isolated. 
The current RATs will likely miss some COVID-19 patients who are shedding 
infectious SARS-CoV-2.

INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in China in 
December, 2019, and declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization 
(WHO) on March 11, 2020. The current management of COVID-19 is based generally 
on supportive therapy and treatment to prevent respiratory failure. The 
effective option of antiviral therapy and vaccination are currently under 
evaluation and development.
AREAS COVERED: A literature search was performed using PubMed between December 
1, 2019-June 23, 2020. This review highlights the current state of knowledge on 
the viral replication and pathogenicity, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, 
and management of COVID-19. This review will be of interest to scientists and 
clinicians and make a significant contribution toward development of vaccines 
and targeted therapies to contain the pandemic.
EXPERT OPINION: The exit strategy for a path back to normal life is required, 
which should involve a multi-prong effort toward development of new treatment 
and a successful vaccine to protect public health worldwide and prevent future 
COVID-19 outbreaks. Therefore, the bench to bedside translational research as 
well as reverse translational works focusing bedside to bench is very important 
and would provide the foundation for the development of targeted drugs and 
vaccines for COVID-19 infections.

BACKGROUND: A false-negative case of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is defined as a person with suspected 
infection and an initial negative result by reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, with a positive result on a subsequent test. 
False-negative cases have important implications for isolation and risk of 
transmission of infected people and for the management of coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to review and critically appraise evidence about the 
rate of RT-PCR false-negatives at initial testing for COVID-19.
METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, as well as COVID-19 repositories, 
including the EPPI-Centre living systematic map of evidence about COVID-19 and 
the Coronavirus Open Access Project living evidence database. Two authors 
independently screened and selected studies according to the eligibility 
criteria and collected data from the included studies. The risk of bias was 
assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) 
tool. We calculated the proportion of false-negative test results using a 
multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model. The certainty of the evidence 
about false-negative cases was rated using the GRADE approach for tests and 
strategies. All information in this article is current up to July 17, 2020.
RESULTS: We included 34 studies enrolling 12,057 COVID-19 confirmed cases. All 
studies were affected by several risks of bias and applicability concerns. The 
pooled estimate of false-negative proportion was highly affected by unexplained 
heterogeneity (tau-squared = 1.39; 90% prediction interval from 0.02 to 0.54). 
The certainty of the evidence was judged as very low due to the risk of bias, 
indirectness, and inconsistency issues.
CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial and largely unexplained heterogeneity in the 
proportion of false-negative RT-PCR results. The collected evidence has several 
limitations, including risk of bias issues, high heterogeneity, and concerns 
about its applicability. Nonetheless, our findings reinforce the need for 
repeated testing in patients with suspicion of SARS-Cov-2 infection given that 
up to 54% of COVID-19 patients may have an initial false-negative RT-PCR (very 
low certainty of evidence).

Accurate and rapid diagnostic tests are critical for achieving control of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), a pandemic illness caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Diagnostic tests for covid-19 
fall into two main categories: molecular tests that detect viral RNA, and 
serological tests that detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins. Reverse 
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a molecular test, has become 
the gold standard for diagnosis of covid-19; however, this test has many 
limitations that include potential false negative results, changes in diagnostic 
accuracy over the disease course, and precarious availability of test materials. 
Serological tests have generated substantial interest as an alternative or 
complement to RT-PCR and other Nucleic acid tests in the diagnosis of acute 
infection, as some might be cheaper and easier to implement at the point of 
care. A clear advantage of these tests over RT-PCR is that they can identify 
individuals previously infected by SARS-CoV-2, even if they never underwent 
testing while acutely ill. Many serological tests for covid-19 have become 
available in a short period, including some marketed for use as rapid, 
point-of-care tests. The pace of development has, however, exceeded that of 
rigorous evaluation, and important uncertainty about test accuracy remains.

BACKGROUND: Information is limited regarding the effectiveness of the two-dose 
messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) 
in preventing infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) and in attenuating coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) when 
administered in real-world conditions.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 3975 health care 
personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers. From 
December 14, 2020, to April 10, 2021, the participants completed weekly 
SARS-CoV-2 testing by providing mid-turbinate nasal swabs for qualitative and 
quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. 
The formula for calculating vaccine effectiveness was 100% × (1 - hazard ratio 
for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated vs. unvaccinated participants), with 
adjustments for the propensity to be vaccinated, study site, occupation, and 
local viral circulation.
RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 204 participants (5%), of whom 5 were fully 
vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 2), 11 partially vaccinated (≥14 days after dose 
1 and <14 days after dose 2), and 156 unvaccinated; the 32 participants with 
indeterminate vaccination status (<14 days after dose 1) were excluded. Adjusted 
vaccine effectiveness was 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 76 to 97) with full 
vaccination and 81% (95% CI, 64 to 90) with partial vaccination. Among 
participants with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mean viral RNA load was 40% lower 
(95% CI, 16 to 57) in partially or fully vaccinated participants than in 
unvaccinated participants. In addition, the risk of febrile symptoms was 58% 
lower (relative risk, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.18 to 0.98) and the duration of illness 
was shorter, with 2.3 fewer days spent sick in bed (95% CI, 0.8 to 3.7).
CONCLUSIONS: Authorized mRNA vaccines were highly effective among working-age 
adults in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection when administered in real-world 
conditions, and the vaccines attenuated the viral RNA load, risk of febrile 
symptoms, and duration of illness among those who had breakthrough infection 
despite vaccination. (Funded by the National Center for Immunization and 
Respiratory Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.).

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative 
pathogen for the COVID-19, first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and 
by March 2020, it was declared a pandemic. COVID-19 pandemic has overburdened 
healthcare systems in most countries and has led to massive economic losses. 
SARS-CoV-2 transmission typically occurs by respiratory droplets. The average 
incubation period is 6.4 days and presenting symptoms typically include fever, 
cough, dyspnea, myalgia or fatigue. While the majority of patients tend to have 
a mild illness, a minority of patients develop severe hypoxia requiring 
hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. Management is mostly supportive. 
However, several direct anti-viral agents, and immunomodulatory therapy with 
steroids and various cytokine blockers seem promising in early results. However, 
an effective vaccine has been established, which will help curb the pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To collate the evidence on the accuracy parameters of all available 
diagnostic methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed. Searches were 
conducted in Pubmed and Scopus (April 2020). Studies reporting data on 
sensitivity or specificity of diagnostic tests for COVID-19 using any human 
biological sample were included.
RESULTS: Sixteen studies were evaluated. Meta-analysis showed that computed 
tomography has high sensitivity (91.9% [89.8%-93.7%]), but low specificity 
(25.1% [21.0%-29.5%]). The combination of IgM and IgG antibodies demonstrated 
promising results for both parameters (84.5% [82.2%-86.6%]; 91.6% [86.0%-95.4%], 
respectively). For RT-PCR tests, rectal stools/swab, urine, and plasma were less 
sensitive while sputum (97.2% [90.3%-99.7%]) presented higher sensitivity for 
detecting the virus.
CONCLUSIONS: RT-PCR remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in 
sputum samples. However, the combination of different diagnostic tests is highly 
recommended to achieve adequate sensitivity and specificity.

OBJECTIVES: To our knowledge no previous study has assessed the performance of a 
rapid antigen diagnostic immunoassay (RAD) conducted at the point of care (POC). 
We evaluated the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device for diagnosis of 
coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in symptomatic patients (n = 412) attending 
primary healthcare centres.
METHODS: RAD was performed immediately after sampling following the 
manufacturer's instructions (reading at 15 min). RT-PCRs were carried out within 
24 h of specimen collection. Samples displaying discordant results were 
processed for culture in Vero E6 cells. Presence of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in cell cultures was confirmed by RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Out of 412 patients, 43 (10.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR and RAD, and 
358 (86.9%) tested negative by both methods; discordant results (RT-PCR+/RAD-) 
were obtained in 11 patients (2.7%). Overall specificity and sensitivity of 
rapid antigen detection (RAD) was 100% (95%CI 98.7-100%) and 79.6% (95%CI 
67.0-88.8%), respectively, taking RT-PCR as the reference. Overall RAD negative 
predictive value for an estimated prevalence of 5% and 10% was 99% (95%CI 
97.4-99.6%) and 97.9% (95%CI 95.9-98.9), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 could not be 
cultured from specimens yielding RT-PCR+/RAD- results (n = 11).
CONCLUSION: The Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device performed well as a POC 
test for early diagnosis of COVID-19 in primary healthcare centres. More 
crucially, the data suggested that patients with RT-PCR-proven COVID-19 testing 
negative by RAD are unlikely to be infectious.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by a novel betacoronavirus, severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has rapidly developed into a 
pandemic since it was first reported in December 2019. Nucleic acid testing is 
the standard method for the diagnosis of viral infections. However, this method 
reportedly has a low positivity rate. To increase the sensitivity of COVID-19 
diagnoses, we developed an IgM-IgG combined assay and tested it in patients with 
suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. In total, 56 patients were enrolled in this 
study and SARS-CoV-2 was detected by using both IgM-IgG antibody and nucleic 
acid tests. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Our 
findings suggest that patients who develop severe illness might experience 
longer virus exposure times and develop a more severe inflammatory response. The 
IgM-IgG test is an accurate and sensitive diagnostic method. A combination of 
nucleic acid and IgM-IgG testing is a more sensitive and accurate approach for 
diagnosis and early treatment of COVID-19.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute 
respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to millions of confirmed 
cases and deaths worldwide. Efficient diagnostic tools are in high demand, as 
rapid and large-scale testing plays a pivotal role in patient management and 
decelerating disease spread. This paper reviews current technologies used to 
detect SARS-CoV-2 in clinical laboratories as well as advances made for 
molecular, antigen-based, and immunological point-of-care testing, including 
recent developments in sensor and biosensor devices. The importance of the 
timing and type of specimen collection is discussed, along with factors such as 
disease prevalence, setting, and methods. Details of the mechanisms of action of 
the various methodologies are presented, along with their application span and 
known performance characteristics. Diagnostic imaging techniques and biomarkers 
are also covered, with an emphasis on their use for assessing COVID-19 or 
monitoring disease severity or complications. While the SARS-CoV-2 literature is 
rapidly evolving, this review highlights topics of interest that have occurred 
during the pandemic and the lessons learned throughout. Exploring a broad 
armamentarium of techniques for detecting SARS-CoV-2 will ensure continued 
diagnostic support for clinicians, public health, and infection prevention and 
control for this pandemic and provide advice for future pandemic preparedness.

Without modern medical management and vaccines, the severity of the Coronavirus 
Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
(SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might approach the magnitude of 1894-plague 
(12 million deaths) and 1918-A(H1N1) influenza (50 million deaths) pandemics. 
The COVID-19 pandemic was heralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the 
discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs, Middle East 
respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel 
animal coronaviruses. The suspected animal-to-human jumping of 4 
betacoronaviruses including the human coronaviruses OC43(1890), 
SARS-CoV-1(2003), MERS-CoV(2012), and SARS-CoV-2(2019) indicates their 
significant pandemic potential. The presence of a large reservoir of 
coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them 
in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating exotic mammals in 
highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels from these areas 
are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. The possibility 
of emergence of a hypothetical SARS-CoV-3 or other novel viruses from animals or 
laboratories, and therefore needs for global preparedness should not be ignored. 
We reviewed representative publications on the epidemiology, virology, clinical 
manifestations, pathology, laboratory diagnostics, treatment, vaccination, and 
infection control of COVID-19 as of 20 January 2021, which is 1 year after 
person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was announced. The difficulties of 
mass testing, labour-intensive contact tracing, importance of compliance to 
universal masking, low efficacy of antiviral treatment for severe disease, 
possibilities of vaccine or antiviral-resistant virus variants and SARS-CoV-2 
becoming another common cold coronavirus are discussed.

The 2020 International Web Scientific Event in COVID-19 pandemic in critically 
ill patients aimed at updating the information and knowledge on the COVID-19 
pandemic in the intensive care unit. Experts reviewed the latest literature 
relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in critically ill patients, such as 
epidemiology, pathophysiology, phenotypes of infection, COVID-19 as a systematic 
infection, molecular diagnosis, mechanical ventilation, thromboprophylaxis, 
COVID-19 associated co-infections, immunotherapy, plasma treatment, 
catheter-related bloodstream infections, artificial intelligence for COVID-19, 
and vaccination. Antiviral therapy and co-infections are out of the scope of 
this review. In this review, each of these issues is discussed with key messages 
regarding management and further research being presented after a brief review 
of available evidence.

An unprecedented worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 has imposed severe 
challenges on healthcare facilities and medical infrastructure. The global 
research community faces urgent calls for the development of rapid diagnostic 
tools, effective treatment protocols, and most importantly, vaccines against the 
pathogen. Pooling together expertise across broad domains to innovate effective 
solutions is the need of the hour. With these requirements in mind, in this 
review, we provide detailed critical accounts on the leading efforts at 
developing diagnostics tools, therapeutic agents, and vaccine candidates. 
Importantly, we furnish the reader with a multidisciplinary perspective on how 
conventional methods like serology and RT-PCR, as well as cutting-edge 
technologies like CRISPR/Cas and artificial intelligence/machine learning, are 
being employed to inform and guide such investigations. We expect this narrative 
to serve a broad audience of both active and aspiring researchers in the field 
of biomedical sciences and engineering and help inspire radical new approaches 
towards effective detection, treatment, and prevention of this global pandemic.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms can be mistaken for vaccine-related side 
effects during initial days after immunization. Among 4,081 vaccinated 
healthcare workers in Israel, 22 (0.54%) developed COVID-19 from 1-10 days 
(median 3.5 days) after immunization. Clinicians should not dismiss 
postvaccination symptoms as vaccine-related and should promptly test for 
COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: To review the available literature concerning the effectiveness of 
the COVID-19 diagnostic tools.
BACKGROUND: With the absence of specific treatment/vaccines for the coronavirus 
COVID-19, the most appropriate approach to control this infection is to 
quarantine people and isolate symptomatic people and suspected or infected 
cases. Although real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) assay is considered the first tool to make a definitive diagnosis of 
COVID-19 disease, the high false negative rate, low sensitivity, limited 
supplies and strict requirements for laboratory settings might delay accurate 
diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) has been reported as an important tool to 
identify and investigate suspected patients with COVID-19 disease at early 
stage.
KEY FINDINGS: RT-PCR shows low sensitivity (60-71%) in diagnosing patients with 
COVID-19 infection compared to the CT chest. Several studies reported that chest 
CT scans show typical imaging features in all patients with COVID-19. This high 
sensitivity and initial presentation in CT chest can be helpful in rectifying 
false negative results obtained from RT-PCR. As COVID-19 has similar 
manifestations to other pneumonia diseases, artificial intelligence (AI) might 
help radiologists to differentiate COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases.
CONCLUSION: Although CT scan is a powerful tool in COVID-19 diagnosis, it is not 
sufficient to detect COVID-19 alone due to the low specificity (25%), and 
challenges that radiologists might face in differentiating COVID-19 from other 
viral pneumonia on chest CT scans. AI might help radiologists to differentiate 
COVID-19 from other pneumonia diseases.
IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: Both RT-PCR and CT tests together would increase 
sensitivity and improve quarantine efficacy, an impact neither could achieve 
alone.

Antibody tests for detecting past infection with severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have many uses for public health decision 
making, but demand has largely come from individual consumers. This review 
focuses on the individual relevance of antibody tests: their accuracy in 
detecting prior infection, what past SARS-CoV-2 infection can currently infer 
about future immunity or possible medical sequelae, and the potential future 
importance of antibody tests for vaccine selection and medical screening. Given 
uncertainty about the antibody tests (quality, accuracy level, positive 
predictive value) and what those tests might indicate immunologically 
(durability of antibodies and necessity for protection from reinfection), 
seropositive test results should not be used to inform individual decision 
making, and antibody testing should remain a tool of public health at this time.

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) face many challenges in controlling 
COVID-19. Healthcare resources are limited and so are ICU beds. RT-PCR testing 
is conducted on a limited scale and treatment options are few. There is no 
vaccine. Therefore, what low-cost solutions remain for the prevention, 
diagnosis, and treatment of SARS-CoV-2? How should these essential health 
services be delivered in order to reach the most vulnerable in our societies? In 
this editorial we discuss several important strategies for controlling COVID-19 
including: vaccination, molecular and serological diagnostics, hygiene and WaSH 
interventions, and low-cost therapeutics. We also discuss the delivery of such 
services in order to reach the most in need. The proposed integrated control 
strategy requires immediate action and political will in order to reduce the 
widening health inequalities caused by the pandemic.

BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to spread 
across the world. Hence, there is an urgent need for rapid, simple, and accurate 
tests to diagnose severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
infection. Performance characteristics of the rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection 
test should be evaluated and compared with the gold standard real-time reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for diagnosis of COVID-19 
cases.
METHODS: The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test, Standard™ Q COVID-19 Ag 
kit (SD Biosensor®, Republic of Korea), was compared with the real-time RT-PCR 
test, Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene®, Korea) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 
respiratory specimens. Four hundred fifty-four respiratory samples (mainly 
nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) were obtained from COVID-19 suspected cases and 
contact individuals, including pre-operative patients at Siriraj Hospital, 
Bangkok, Thailand during March-May 2020.
RESULTS: Of 454 respiratory samples, 60 (13.2%) were positive, and 394 (86.8%) 
were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time RT-PCR assay. The duration from 
onset to laboratory test in COVID-19 suspected cases and contact individuals 
ranged from 0 to 14 days with a median of 3 days. The rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen 
detection test's sensitivity and specificity were 98.33% (95% CI, 91.06-99.96%) 
and 98.73% (95% CI, 97.06-99.59%), respectively. One false negative test result 
was from a sample with a high real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct), while five 
false positive test results were from specimens of pre-operative patients.
CONCLUSIONS: The rapid assay for SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection showed comparable 
sensitivity and specificity with the real-time RT-PCR assay. Thus, there is a 
potential use of this rapid and simple SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test as a 
screening assay.

Molecular diagnostics has been the front runner in the world's response to the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Particularly, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) and the quantitative variant (qRT-PCR) have been the gold standard for 
COVID-19 diagnosis. However, faster antigen tests and other point-of-care (POC) 
devices have also played a significant role in containing the spread of 
SARS-CoV-2 by facilitating mass screening and delivering results in less time. 
Thus, despite the higher sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR assays, the 
impact of POC tests cannot be ignored. As a consequence, there has been an 
increased interest in the development of miniaturized, high-throughput, and 
automated PCR systems, many of which can be used at point-of-care. This review 
summarizes the recent advances in the development of miniaturized PCR systems 
with an emphasis on COVID-19 detection. The distinct features of digital PCR and 
electrochemical PCR are detailed along with the challenges. The potential of 
CRISPR/Cas technology for POC diagnostics is also highlighted. Commercial RT-PCR 
POC systems approved by various agencies for COVID-19 detection are discussed.

The emergence of novel and evolving variants of SARS-CoV-2 has fostered the need 
for change in the form of newer and more adaptive diagnostic methods for the 
detection of SARS-CoV-2 infections. On the other hand, developing rapid and 
sensitive diagnostic technologies is now more challenging due to emerging 
variants and varying symptoms exhibited among the infected individuals. In 
addition to this, vaccines remain the major mainstay of prevention and 
protection against infection. Novel vaccines and drugs are constantly being 
developed to unleash an immune response for the robust targeting of SARS-CoV-2 
and its associated variants. In this review, we provide an updated perspective 
on the current challenges posed by the emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 
mutants/variants and the evolution of diagnostic techniques to enable their 
detection. In addition, we also discuss the development, formulation, working 
mechanisms, advantages, and drawbacks of some of the most used 
vaccines/therapeutic drugs and their subsequent immunological impact.Key 
messageThe emergence of novel variants of the SARS-CoV-2 in the past couple of 
months, highlights one of the primary challenges in the diagnostics, treatment, 
as well as vaccine development against the virus.Advancements in SARS-CoV-2 
detection include nucleic acid based, antigen and immuno- assay-based and 
antibody-based detection methodologies for efficient, robust, and quick testing; 
while advancements in COVID-19 preventive and therapeutic strategies include 
novel antiviral and immunomodulatory drugs and SARS-CoV-2 targeted vaccines.The 
varied COVID-19 vaccine platforms and the immune responses induced by each one 
of them as well as their ability to battle post-vaccination infections have all 
been discussed in this review.

Recently, the number of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who 
have tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2), via the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) 
test, after recovery has increased; this has caused a dilemma regarding the 
medical measures and policies. We evaluated the dynamics of viral load and 
anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in four patients with positive RT-PCR results after 
recovery. In all patients, the highest levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM 
antibodies were reached after about a month of the onset of the initial 
symptoms. Then, the IgG titers plateaued, and the IgM titers decreased, 
regardless of RT-PCR results. The IgG and IgM levels did not increase after the 
post-negative positive RT-PCR results in any of the patients. Our results 
reinforced that the post-negative positive RT-PCR results may be due to the 
detection of RNA particles rather than reinfection in individuals who have 
recovered from COVID-19.

To provide a comprehensive and systematic analysis of demographic 
characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and imaging features of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pediatric patients. A meta-analysis was 
carried out to identify studies on COVID-19 from 25 December 2019 to 30 April 
2020. A total of 48 studies with 5829 pediatric patients were included. Children 
of all ages were at risk for COVID-19. The main illness classification ranged 
as: 20% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14%-26%; I2  = 91.4%) asymptomatic, 33% 
(95% CI: 23%-43%; I2  = 95.6%) mild and 51% (95% CI: 42%-61%; I2  = 93.4%) 
moderate. The typical clinical manifestations were fever 51% (95% CI: 45%-57%; 
I2  = 78.9%) and cough 41% (95% CI: 35%-47%, I2  = 81.0%). The common laboratory 
findings were normal white blood cell 69% (95% CI: 64%-75%; I2  = 58.5%), 
lymphopenia 16% (95% CI: 11%-21%; I2  = 76.9%) and elevated creatine-kinase MB 
37% (95% CI: 25%-48%; I2  = 59.0%). The frequent imaging features were normal 
images 41% (95% CI: 30%-52%; I2  = 93.4%) and ground-glass opacity 36% (95% CI: 
25%-47%; I2  = 92.9%). Among children under 1 year old, critical cases account 
for 14% (95% CI: 13%-34%; I2  = 37.3%) that should be of concern. In addition, 
vomiting occurred in 33% (95% CI: 18%-67%; I2  = 0.0%) cases that may also need 
attention. Pediatric patients with COVID-19 may experience milder illness with 
atypical clinical manifestations and rare lymphopenia. High incidence of 
critical illness and vomiting symptoms reward attention in children under 1 year 
old.

Asymptomatic individuals with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have been 
identified via nucleic acid testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); however, the epidemiologic characteristics and viral 
shedding pattern of asymptomatic patients remain largely unknown. In this study, 
serological testing was applied when identifying nine asymptomatic cases of 
COVID-19 who showed persistent negative RT-PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2 
nucleic acid and no symptoms of COVID-19. Two asymptomatic cases were presumed 
to be index patients who had cleared the virus when their close contacts 
developed symptoms of COVID-19. Three of the asymptomatic cases were local 
individuals who spontaneously recovered before their presumed index patients 
developed symptoms of COVID-19. This report presents the epidemiologic and 
clinical characteristics of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection 
that were undetected on RT-PCR tests in previous epidemiologic investigations 
probably due to the transient viral shedding duration.

To combat the enduring and dangerous spread of COVID-19, many innovations to 
rapid diagnostics have been developed based on proteinprotein interactions of 
the SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins to increase testing 
accessibility. These antigen tests have most prominently been developed using 
the lateral flow assay (LFA) test platform which has the benefit of 
administration at point-of-care, delivering quick results, lower cost, and does 
not require skilled personnel. However, they have gained criticism for an 
inferior sensitivity. In the last year, much attention has been given to 
creating a rapid LFA test for detection of COVID-19 antigens that can address 
its high limit of detection while retaining the advantages of rapid 
antibodyantigen interaction. In this review, a summary of these proteinprotein 
interactions as well as the challenges, benefits, and recent improvements to 
protein based LFA for detection of COVID-19 are discussed.

INTRODUCTION: SARS-Cov-2 first appeared in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and 
spread all over the world soon after that. Given the infectious nature 
ofSARS-CoV-2, fast and accurate diagnosis tools are important to detect the 
virus. In this review, we discuss the different diagnostic tests that are 
currently being implemented in laboratories and provide a description of various 
COVID-19 kits.
AREAS COVERED: We summarize molecular techniques that target the viral load, 
serological methods used for SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies detection as well as 
newly developed faster assays for the detection of SARS-COV 2 in various 
biological samples.
EXPERT OPINION: In the light of the widespread pandemic, the massive diagnosis 
of COVID-19, using various detection techniques, appears to be the most 
effective strategy for monitoring and containing its propagation.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of mRNA covid-19 vaccines against 
symptomatic infection and severe outcomes (hospital admission or death).
DESIGN: Test negative design study.
SETTING: Ontario, Canada between 14 December 2020 and 19 April 2021.
PARTICIPANTS: 324 033 community dwelling people aged ≥16 years who had symptoms 
of covid-19 and were tested for SARS-CoV-2.
INTERVENTIONS: BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and hospital admissions and deaths associated 
with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Multivariable logistic regression was adjusted for 
personal and clinical characteristics associated with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccine 
receipt to estimate vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection and 
severe outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 324 033 people with symptoms, 53 270 (16.4%) were positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 and 21 272 (6.6%) received at least one dose of vaccine. Among 
participants who tested positive, 2479 (4.7%) were admitted to hospital or died. 
Vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection observed ≥14 days after one 
dose was 60% (95% confidence interval 57% to 64%), increasing from 48% (41% to 
54%) at 14-20 days after one dose to 71% (63% to 78%) at 35-41 days. Vaccine 
effectiveness observed ≥7 days after two doses was 91% (89% to 93%). Vaccine 
effectiveness against hospital admission or death observed ≥14 days after one 
dose was 70% (60% to 77%), increasing from 62% (44% to 75%) at 14-20 days to 91% 
(73% to 97%) at ≥35 days, whereas vaccine effectiveness observed ≥7 days after 
two doses was 98% (88% to 100%). For adults aged ≥70 years, vaccine 
effectiveness estimates were observed to be lower for intervals shortly after 
one dose but were comparable to those for younger people for all intervals after 
28 days. After two doses, high vaccine effectiveness was observed against 
variants with the E484K mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of mRNA covid-19 vaccines were observed to be highly 
effective against symptomatic infection and severe outcomes. Vaccine 
effectiveness of one dose was observed to be lower, particularly for older 
adults shortly after the first dose.

In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, one potential cause 
of concern is that some discharged COVID-19 patients are testing positive again 
for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA. To better 
understand what is happening and to provide public health policy planners and 
clinicians timely information, we have searched and reviewed published studies 
about discharged patients testing positive again for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Our 
search found 12 reports, all of which described patients in China. Our review of 
these reports indicates the presence of discharged patients who remain 
asymptomatic but test positive. However, it is unclear whether they are 
contagious because a positive reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction 
(RT- PCR) test does not necessarily indicate the presence of replicating and 
transmissible virus. Our review suggests the need for timely, parallel testing 
of different samples, including, for example, fecal specimens, from COVID-19 
patients before and after they are discharged from hospitals.

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in a world-wide 
crisis. To contain the virus, it is important to find infected individuals and 
isolate them to stop transmission. Various diagnostic techniques are used to 
check for infection. With the havoc that severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has created, it is imperative to work on alternative 
diagnostic techniques that can be used at both point of care with little or no 
expertise and at mass testing (i.e., when screening). Despite extensive 
research, to this date no specific effective treatment or cure is available to 
neutralize this viral infection. Globally, researchers are working to develop 
effective treatments, and several vaccines have been approved for public use. We 
found the studies that we explored for this review using appropriate key words 
for indexing in PubMed and Google Scholar from 2019 to 2020. We compile various 
techniques that have been used worldwide to diagnose and treat SARS-CoV-2 and 
discuss novel methods that may be modified for use in diagnosis and treatment. 
It is crucial to develop a more specific serological test for diagnosis that can 
rule out the possibility of COVID-19 and be used for mass testing. An 
affordable, safe, targeted, effective treatment must be developed to cure this 
disease, which has created a public health emergency of international concern.

The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a severe threat to human 
health and the global economy and has resulted in overwhelming stress on health 
care systems worldwide. Despite the global health catastrophe, especially in the 
number of infections and fatalities, the COVID-19 pandemic has also 
revolutionized research and discovery with remarkable success in diagnostics, 
treatments, and vaccine development. The use of many diagnostic methods has 
helped establish public health guidelines to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. 
However, limited information has been shared about these methods, and there is a 
need for the scientific community to learn about these technologies, in addition 
to their sensitivity, specificity, and limitations. This review article is 
focused on providing insights into the major methods used for SARS-CoV-2 
detection. We describe in detail the core principle of each method, including 
molecular and serological approaches, along with reported claims about the rates 
of false negatives and false positives, the types of specimens needed, and the 
level of technology and the time required to perform each test. Although this 
study will not rank or prioritize these methods, the information will help in 
the development of guidelines and diagnostic protocols in clinical settings and 
reference laboratories.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness of the inactivated whole virus vaccine, 
CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech), against symptomatic covid-19 in the elderly 
population of São Paulo state, Brazil during widespread circulation of the gamma 
variant.
DESIGN: Test negative case-control study.
SETTING: Community testing for covid-19 in São Paulo state, Brazil.
PARTICIPANTS: 43 774 adults aged ≥70 years who were residents of São Paulo state 
and underwent reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing 
for SARS-CoV-2 from 17 January to 29 April 2021. 26 433 cases with symptomatic 
covid-19 and 17 622 test negative controls with covid-19 symptoms were formed 
into 13 283 matched sets, one case with to up to five controls, according to 
age, sex, self-reported race, municipality of residence, previous covid-19 
status, and date of RT-PCR test (±3 days).
INTERVENTION: Vaccination with a two dose regimen of CoronaVac.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RT-PCR confirmed symptomatic covid-19 and associated 
hospital admissions and deaths.
RESULTS: Adjusted vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic covid-19 was 24.7% 
(95% confidence interval 14.7% to 33.4%) at 0-13 days and 46.8% (38.7% to 53.8%) 
at ≥14 days after the second dose. Adjusted vaccine effectiveness against 
hospital admissions was 55.5% (46.5% to 62.9%) and against deaths was 61.2% 
(48.9% to 70.5%) at ≥14 days after the second dose. Vaccine effectiveness ≥14 
days after the second dose was highest for the youngest age group (70-74 
years)-59.0% (43.7% to 70.2%) against symptomatic disease, 77.6% (62.5% to 
86.7%) against hospital admissions, and 83.9% (59.2% to 93.7%) against 
deaths-and declined with increasing age.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with CoronaVac was associated with a reduction in 
symptomatic covid-19, hospital admissions, and deaths in adults aged ≥70 years 
in a setting with extensive transmission of the gamma variant. Vaccine 
protection was, however, low until completion of the two dose regimen, and 
vaccine effectiveness was observe to decline with increasing age among this 
elderly population.

BACKGROUND: On Dec 8, 2020, deployment of the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 
authorised for UK use (BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine) began, followed by an adenoviral 
vector vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 on Jan 4, 2021. Care home residents and staff, 
frontline health-care workers, and adults aged 80 years and older were 
vaccinated first. However, few data exist regarding the effectiveness of these 
vaccines in older people with many comorbidities. In this post-implementation 
evaluation of two COVID-19 vaccines, we aimed to determine the effectiveness of 
one dose in reducing COVID-19-related admissions to hospital in people of 
advanced age.
METHODS: This prospective test-negative case-control study included adults aged 
at least 80 years who were admitted to hospital in two NHS trusts in Bristol, UK 
with signs and symptoms of respiratory disease. Patients who developed symptoms 
before receiving their vaccine or those who received their vaccine after 
admission to hospital were excluded, as were those with symptoms that started 
more than 10 days before hospital admission. We did logistic regression 
analysis, controlling for time (week), sex, index of multiple deprivations, and 
care residency status, and sensitivity analyses matched for time and sex using a 
conditional logistic model adjusting for index of multiple deprivations and care 
residency status. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 39557.
FINDINGS: Between Dec 18, 2020, and Feb 26, 2021, 466 adults were eligible (144 
test-positive and 322 test-negative). 18 (13%) of 135 people with SARS-CoV-2 
infection and 90 (34%) of 269 controls received one dose of BNT162b2. The 
adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 71·4% (95% CI 46·5-90·6). Nine (25%) of 36 
people with COVID-19 infection and 53 (59%) of 90 controls received one dose of 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19. The adjusted vaccine effectiveness was 80·4% (95% CI 
36·4-94·5). When BNT162b2 effectiveness analysis was restricted to the period 
covered by ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the estimate was 79·3% (95% CI 47·0-92·5).
INTERPRETATION: One dose of either BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 resulted in 
substantial risk reductions of COVID-19-related hospitalisation in people aged 
at least 80 years.

The diagnosis of COVID-19 requires integration of clinical and laboratory data. 
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostic assays 
play a central role in diagnosis and have fixed technical performance metrics. 
Interpretation becomes challenging because the clinical sensitivity changes as 
the virus clears and the immune response emerges. Our goal was to examine the 
clinical sensitivity of two most common SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test modalities, 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology, over the disease course to provide 
insight into their clinical interpretation in patients presenting to the 
hospital. We conducted a single-center, retrospective study. To derive clinical 
sensitivity of PCR, we identified 209 PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 patients with 
multiple PCR test results (624 total PCR tests) and calculated daily sensitivity 
from date of symptom onset or first positive test. Clinical sensitivity of PCR 
decreased with days post symptom onset with >90% clinical sensitivity during the 
first 5 days after symptom onset, 70%-71% from Days 9 to 11, and 30% at Day 21. 
To calculate daily clinical sensitivity by serology, we utilized 157 
PCR-positive patients with a total of 197 specimens tested by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. In 
contrast to PCR, serological sensitivity increased with days post symptom onset 
with >50% of patients seropositive by at least one antibody isotype after Day 7, 
>80% after Day 12, and 100% by Day 21. Taken together, PCR and serology are 
complimentary modalities that require time-dependent interpretation. 
Superimposition of sensitivities over time indicate that serology can function 
as a reliable diagnostic aid indicating recent or prior infection.

The COVID-19 pandemic challenges have been only partially addressed so far. The 
pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 is considered the combination of severe and high 
infectivity. Herdimmunity is attained when a critical proportion of the 
population is immune, providing the virus with fewer chances to spread locally. 
To overcome the rising tide of the COVID-19 pandemic, efficacious and safe 
vaccines providing defensive and long-lasting immunity responses are urgently 
needed.Vaccines that induce virus-neutralizing antibodies with great affinity 
can optimally fight against infection. Worldwide, over 120 novel vaccine 
candidates, including live-attenuated, inactivated, viral-vectored 
nonreplicating and replicating, peptide- and protein-based, and nucleic 
acid-based approaches are in the process of preclinical and clinical trials 
(phase 1-4). In addition to comprehensive safety assessments and immune 
responses, precise clinical management is also important for trials of vaccines. 
The recent emergence of different variants of SARS-CoV-2 is becoming a new 
threat for the world and a challenge for scientists to introduce the most 
influential vaccine against COVID-19. The possibility of natural and 
vaccine-induced immunity in variants finds it necessary to establish 
next-generation vaccines, which generate general neutralization against existing 
and future variants. Here, we summarize the cellular and humoral responses of 
SARS-CoV-2, current progress in vaccination development, the antibody titer 
response of available phase 4 vaccinations in vaccinated populations of 
different countries worldwide, and the success and challenges ahead of vaccine 
development.

BACKGROUND: Observational evidence suggests that mask wearing mitigates 
transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It 
is uncertain if this observed association arises through protection of 
uninfected wearers (protective effect), via reduced transmission from infected 
mask wearers (source control), or both.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside the home 
reduces wearers' risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a setting where masks were 
uncommon and not among recommended public health measures.
DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial (DANMASK-19 [Danish Study to Assess Face 
Masks for the Protection Against COVID-19 Infection]). (ClinicalTrials.gov: 
NCT04337541).
SETTING: Denmark, April and May 2020.
PARTICIPANTS: Adults spending more than 3 hours per day outside the home without 
occupational mask use.
INTERVENTION: Encouragement to follow social distancing measures for coronavirus 
disease 2019, plus either no mask recommendation or a recommendation to wear a 
mask when outside the home among other persons together with a supply of 50 
surgical masks and instructions for proper use.
MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection in the mask wearer at 
1 month by antibody testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or hospital 
diagnosis. The secondary outcome was PCR positivity for other respiratory 
viruses.
RESULTS: A total of 3030 participants were randomly assigned to the 
recommendation to wear masks, and 2994 were assigned to control; 4862 completed 
the study. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 occurred in 42 participants recommended 
masks (1.8%) and 53 control participants (2.1%). The between-group difference 
was -0.3 percentage point (95% CI, -1.2 to 0.4 percentage point; P = 0.38) (odds 
ratio, 0.82 [CI, 0.54 to 1.23]; P = 0.33). Multiple imputation accounting for 
loss to follow-up yielded similar results. Although the difference observed was 
not statistically significant, the 95% CIs are compatible with a 46% reduction 
to a 23% increase in infection.
LIMITATION: Inconclusive results, missing data, variable adherence, 
patient-reported findings on home tests, no blinding, and no assessment of 
whether masks could decrease disease transmission from mask wearers to others.
CONCLUSION: The recommendation to wear surgical masks to supplement other public 
health measures did not reduce the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate among wearers by 
more than 50% in a community with modest infection rates, some degree of social 
distancing, and uncommon general mask use. The data were compatible with lesser 
degrees of self-protection.

Introduction: A novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) was reported via nucleic acid identification in December, 2019. 
Accuracy of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic assays has emerged as a major barrier to 
COVID-19 diagnosis, particularly in cases requiring urgent or emergent 
treatment.Areas covered: In this review, we explore the major reasons for 
false-positive and false-negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. How clinical 
characteristics, specific respiratory comorbidities and SARS-CoV-2 vaccination 
impact on existing diagnostic assays are highlighted. Different COVID-19 
management algorithms based on each test and limitations are thoroughly 
presented.Expert opinion: The diagnostic accuracy and the capacity of every 
available assay, which need to be interpreted in the light of the background 
incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the communities in which they are used, are 
essential in order to minimize the number of falsely tested cases. Automated 
testing platforms may enhance diagnostic accuracy by minimizing the potential 
for human error in assays' performance. Prior immunization against SARS-CoV-2 
impairs the utility of serologic testing of suspected COVID-19 cases. Future 
avenues of research to evaluate lung tissue innate immune responses hold promise 
as a target for research to optimize SARS-CoV-2 and future infections' testing 
accuracy.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is emerging as a global pandemic outbreak. To date, 
approximately one million deaths and over 32 million cases have been reported. 
This ongoing pandemic urgently requires an accurate testing device that can be 
used in the field in a fast manner. Serological assays to detect antibodies have 
been proven to be a great complement to the standard method of reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), particularly after the second 
week of infection. We have developed a specific and sensitive immunosensor for 
immunoglobulin detection produced against SARS-CoV-2. Unlike other lateral 
flow-based assays (LFAs) involving the utilization of multiple antibodies, we 
have reported a label-free paper-based electrochemical platform targeting 
SARS-CoV-2 antibodies without the specific requirement of an antibody. The 
presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will interrupt the redox conversion of the 
redox indicator, resulting in a decreased current response. This electrochemical 
sensor was proven effective in real clinical sera from patients with 
satisfactory results. In addition, the proposed format was also extended to 
antigen detection (the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2), which presents new 
possibilities for diagnosing COVID-19.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic persists with all its virulence despite 650,382,819 
doses of COVID vaccine worldwide. The reference test for infection 
identification is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The 
usefulness of this test may be diminished by simplifying its result as positive 
or negative. Determining the number of cycles (Ct) in positive RT-qPCR tests can 
assist in decision-making when interpreted in the clinical context of patients.

The immense patient number caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global 
pandemic brings the urge for more knowledge about its immunological features, 
including the profile of basic immune parameters. In this study, eighty-eight 
reported COVID-19 patients in Wuhan were recruited from January to February, 
2020, including 32 severe/critical cases and 56 mild/moderate cases. Their mean 
age was 56.43 years (range 17-83) and gender ratio (male/female) was 43:45. We 
tested SARS-CoV-2 RNA with commercial kits, investigated the level of serologic 
IgM and IgG antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) using magnetic particle chemiluminescence immunoassays, and 
compared the results of serologic tests and nucleic acid test (NAT). Among 88 
patients, 95.45% were confirmed as positive by the combination of NAT and 
antibody test, which was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than by single nucleic 
acid test (73.86%) or serologic test (65.91%). Then the correlation between 
temporal profile and the level of antibody response was analyzed. It showed that 
seroconversion started on day 5 after disease onset and IgG level was rose 
earlier than IgM. Comparison between patients with different disease severity 
suggested early seroconversion and high antibody titer were linked with less 
severe clinical symptoms. These results supported the combination of serologic 
testing and NAT in routine COVID-19 diagnosis and provided evidence on the 
temporal profile of antibody response in patients with different disease 
severity.

We investigated the prevalence and clinical outcomes of COVID-19 in recipients 
of kidney transplants in the Bronx, New York, one of the epicenters of the 
pandemic. Between March 16 and June 2, 2020, 132 kidney transplant recipients 
tested positive by SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. From May 3 to July 29, 2020, 912 kidney 
transplant recipients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies during routine 
clinic visits, of which 16.6% tested positive. Fifty-five of the 152 patients 
had previously tested positive by RT-PCR, while the remaining 97 did not have 
significant symptoms and had not been previously tested by RT-PCR. The 
prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 23.4% in the 975 patients tested by 
either RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 IgG. Older patients and patients with higher serum 
creatinine levels were more likely diagnosed by RT-PCR compared to SARS-CoV-2 
IgG. Sixty-nine RT-PCR positive patients were screened for SARS-CoV-2 IgG 
antibodies at a median of 44 days post-diagnosis (Inter Quartile Range 31-58) 
and 80% were positive. Overall mortality was 20.5% but significantly higher 
(37.8%) in the patients who required hospitalization. Twenty-three percent of 
the hospitalized patients required kidney replacement therapy and 6.3% lost 
their allografts. In multivariable analysis, older age, receipt of 
deceased-donor transplantation, lack of influenza vaccination in the previous 
year and higher serum interleukine-6 levels were associated with mortality. 
Thus, 42% of patients with a kidney transplant and with COVID-19 were diagnosed 
on antibody testing without significant clinical symptoms; 80% of patients with 
positive RT-PCR developed SARS-CoV-2 IgG and mortality was high among patients 
requiring hospitalization.

The rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused the COVID-19 disease, has 
highlighted our urgent need for sensitive, fast and accurate diagnostic 
technologies. In fact, one of the main challenges for flatting COVID-19 spread 
charts is the ability to accurately and rapidly identify asymptomatic cases that 
result in spreading the virus to close contacts. SARS-CoV-2 virus mutation is 
also relatively rapid, which makes the detection of COVID-19 diseases still 
crucial even after the vaccination. Conventional techniques, which are 
commercially available have focused on clinical manifestation, along with 
molecular and serological detection tools that can identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus 
however, owing to various disadvantages including low specificity and 
sensitivity, a quick, low cost and easy approach is needed for diagnosis of 
COVID-19. Scientists are now showing extensive interest in an effective portable 
and simple detection method to diagnose COVID-19. There are several novel 
methods and approaches that are considered viable advanced systems that can meet 
the demands. This study reviews the new approaches and sensing technologies that 
work on COVID-19 diagnosis for easy and successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 
virus.

The unending outburst of COVID-19 has reinforced the necessity of SARS-CoV-2 
identification approaches for the prevention of infection transmission and the 
proper care of severe and critical patients. As there is no cure, a prompt and 
reliable diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 is vital to counter the spread and to provide 
adequate care and treatment for the infection. Currently, RT-PCR is a gold 
standard detection method for the qualitative and quantitative detection of 
viral nucleic acids. Besides, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is also a 
primarily used method for qualitative estimation of viral load. However, almost 
all the detection methods have their pros and cons in terms of specificity, 
accuracy, sensitivity, cost, time consumption, the need for sophisticated 
laboratories, and the requirement of skilled technical experts to carry out the 
detection tests. Thus, it is suggested to integrate different techniques to 
enhance the detection efficiency and accurateness for SARS-CoV2. This review 
focuses on preliminary, pre-confirmatory, and confirmatory methods of detection 
such as imaging techniques (chest-X-ray and chest- computed tomography), nucleic 
acid detection methods, serological assay methods, and viral culture and 
identification methods that are currently being employed to detect the presence 
of SARS-CoV-2 infection along with recent detection method and applicability for 
COVID-19.

Although guidance documents have been published regarding organ donation from 
individuals with a prior history of COVID-19 infection, no data exist regarding 
successful recovery and transplantation from deceased donors with a history of 
or positive testing suggesting a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report a 
case series of six deceased donors with a history of COVID-19 from whom 13 
organs were recovered and transplanted through several of the nation's organ 
procurement organizations (OPOs). In addition, at least two potential donors 
were authorized for donation but with no organs were successfully allocated and 
did not proceed to recovery. No transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reported from the 
six donors to recipients, procurement teams, or hospital personnel. Although 
more studies are needed, organ donation from deceased donors who have recovered 
from COVID-19 should be considered.

Diagnostic Accuracy Estimates for COVID-19 Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 
and Lateral Flow Immunoassay Tests With Bayesian Latent-Class Models.

Kostoulas P, Eusebi P, Hartnack S.

Our objective was to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of real-time polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) tests for 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), depending on the time after symptom onset. 
Based on the cross-classified results of RT-PCR and LFIA, we used Bayesian 
latent-class models, which do not require a gold standard for the evaluation of 
diagnostics. Data were extracted from studies that evaluated LFIA 
(immunoglobulin G (IgG) and/or immunoglobulin M (IgM)) assays using RT-PCR as 
the reference method. The sensitivity of RT-PCR was 0.68 (95% probability 
interval (PrI): 0.63, 0.73). IgG/M sensitivity was 0.32 (95% PrI :0.23; 0.41) 
for the first week and increased steadily. It was 0.75 (95% PrI: 0.67; 0.83) and 
0.93 (95% PrI: 0.88; 0.97) for the second and third weeks after symptom onset, 
respectively. Both tests had a high to absolute specificity, with higher point 
median estimates for RT-PCR specificity and narrower probability intervals. The 
specificity of RT-PCR was 0.99 (95% PrI: 0.98; 1.00). and the specificity of 
IgG/IgM was 0.97 (95% PrI: 0.92, 1.00), 0.98 (95% PrI: 0.95, 1.00) and 0.98 (95% 
PrI: 0.94, 1.00) for the first, second, and third weeks after symptom onset. The 
diagnostic accuracy of LFIA varies with time after symptom onset. Bayesian 
latent-class models provide a valid and efficient alternative for evaluating the 
rapidly evolving diagnostics for COVID-19, under various clinical settings and 
different risk profiles.

COVID-19 has become one of the few leading causes of death and has evolved into 
a pandemic that disrupts everyone's routine, and balanced way of life worldwide, 
and will continue to do so. To bring an end to this pandemic, scientists had put 
their all effort into discovering the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 infection. For 
their dedication, now, we have a handful of COVID-19 vaccines. Worldwide, 
millions of people are at risk due to the current pandemic of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
Coronavirus 2). Despite the lack of clinically authorized antiviral medications 
and vaccines for COVID-19, clinical trials of many recognized antiviral agents, 
their combination, and vaccine development in patients with confirmed COVID-19 
are still ongoing. This discovery gave us a chance to get immune to this disease 
worldwide and end the pandemic. However, the unexpected capacity of mutation of 
the SARS-CoV-2 virus makes it difficult, like the recent SAS-CoV-2 Omicron 
variant. Therefore, there is a great necessity to spread the vaccination 
programs and prevent the spread of this dreadful epidemic by identifying and 
isolating afflicted patients. Furthermore, several COVID-19 tests are thought to 
be expensive, time-consuming, and require the use of adequately qualified 
persons to be carried out efficiently. In addition, we also conversed about how 
the various COVID-19 testing methods can be implemented for the first time in a 
developing country and their cost-effectiveness, accuracy, human resources 
requirements, and laboratory facilities.

Patients infected with novel coronavirus exhibit a wide range of symptoms from 
common cold to pneumonia. Furthermore, several cases have been reported as 
asymptomatic across the globe. Since there are no conclusive clinical 
manifestations, clinicians have to rely more on laboratory diagnostic methods 
for confirmation of coronavirus disease. Hematological and biochemical tests are 
found to be of more prognostic value. Genetic assays by means of rRT-PCR 
technique is time-consuming but seems to be a more sensitive and specific test 
among the available testing methods for diagnosis of the coronavirus disease. 
Radiological imaging of the CT chest of the confirmed positive patients taken 
during the initial few days doesn't show any significant changes. However, from 
the second week onward a ground glass lesion pattern is observed. The 
immunological tests which are being used as a rapid testing method are found to 
be more false test negative. Hence, based on the effectiveness of various 
testing methods, it can be concluded that either rRT-PCR or mass antibody 
testing has to be done, and it has to be compared with CT chest in order to 
avoid false negatives across the globe which may help in the prevention of 
community spread of the disease.

BACKGROUND: New York City (NYC) has endured the greatest burden of COVID-19 
infections in the US. Health inequities in South Bronx predisposed this 
community to a large number of infectious cases, hospitalizations, and 
mortality. Health care workers (HCWs) are at a high risk of exposure to the 
infection. This study aims to assess seroprevalence and the associated 
characteristics of consenting HCWs from an NYC public hospital.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study includes serum samples for qualitative 
SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing with nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2; PCR and 
completion of an online survey capturing demographics, COVID-19 symptoms during 
the preceding months on duty, details of healthcare and community exposure, and 
travel history were collected from consenting participants in May 2020. 
Participants' risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection in the hospital and in the 
community was defined based on CDC guidelines. Travel history to high-risk areas 
was also considered an additional risk. The Odds Ratio with bivariable and 
multivariable logistic regression was used to assess characteristics associated 
with seroprevalence.
RESULTS: A total of 500 HCW were tested, 137 (27%) tested positive for the 
SARS-CoV-2 antibody. Symptomatic participants had a 75% rate of seroconversion 
compared to those without symptoms. Subjects with anosmia and ageusia had 
increased odds of seroconversion in comparison to those without these symptoms. 
Community exposure was 34% among those who had positive antibodies.
CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence among HCWs was high compared to the community at the 
epicenter of the pandemic. Further studies to evaluate sustained adaptive 
immunity in this high-risk group will guide our response to a future surge.

The duration of infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2) in living patients has been demarcated. In contrast, a possible 
SARS-CoV-2 infectivity of corpses and subsequently its duration under post 
mortem circumstances remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study was to 
investigate the infectivity and its duration of deceased COVID-19 (coronavirus 
disease) patients. Four SARS-CoV-2 infected deceased patients were subjected to 
medicolegal autopsy. Post mortem intervals (PMI) of 1, 4, 9 and 17 days, 
respectively, were documented. During autopsy, swabs and organ samples were 
taken and examined by RT-qPCR (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA). Determination 
of infectivity was performed by means of virus isolation in cell culture. In two 
cases, virus isolation was successful for swabs and tissue samples of the 
respiratory tract (PMI 4 and 17 days). The two infectious cases showed a shorter 
duration of COVID-19 until death than the two non-infectious cases (2 and 11 
days, respectively, compared to > 19 days), which correlates with studies of 
living patients, in which infectivity could be narrowed to about 6 days before 
to 12 days after symptom onset. Most notably, infectivity was still present in 
one of the COVID-19 corpses after a post-mortem interval of 17 days and despite 
already visible signs of decomposition. To prevent SARS-CoV-2 infections in all 
professional groups involved in the handling and examination of COVID-19 
corpses, adequate personal safety standards (reducing or avoiding aerosol 
formation and wearing FFP3 [filtering face piece class 3] masks) have to be 
enforced for routine procedures.

BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid persists after symptom resolution and infectivity for 
many viral infections via delayed clearance of nucleic acid fragments, 
non-infectious particles, or transmissible virus. For Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19), the relationship between nasopharyngeal (NP) swab positivity, the 
development of antibodies against COVID-19, and clinical history are unclear.
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Individuals who recovered from COVID-19 and 
volunteered to donate convalescent plasma (CP) were screened by NP swab PCR, 
responded to a questionnaire, and were tested for anti-COVID-19 antibodies.
RESULTS: A proportion of 11.8% of individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by 
NP swab PCR greater than 14 days after the resolution of symptoms of active 
disease, including one donor who had asymptomatic disease and tested positive by 
NP swab 41 days after her initial diagnosis. Clinical history did not show a 
significant correlation with persistence of NP swab positivity. Also, NP swab 
positivity >14 days from symptom resolution did not correlate with anti-COVID-19 
serology results. IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody strength correlated with 
hospitalization for COVID-19 using two different assays. Total anti-SARS-CoV-2 
nucleocapsid antibody strength correlated with time from symptom resolution to 
sample collection and symptom duration.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid is detectable long after the resolution of 
symptoms in a significant percentage of previously diagnosed individuals, which 
is important to consider when interpreting PCR swab results. Persistence of PCR 
positivity does not correlate with antibody strength or symptoms of COVID-19. If 
anti-spike antibody is used to assess CP potency, individuals who suffered 
severe COVID-19 disease symptoms may represent better donors.

Tests for Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are intended for a disparate and 
shifting range of purposes: (1) diagnosing patients who present with symptoms to 
inform individual treatment decisions; (2) organizational uses such as 
"cohorting" potentially infected patients and staff to protect others; and (3) 
contact tracing, surveillance, and other public health purposes. Often lost when 
testing is encouraged is that testing does not by itself confer health benefits. 
Rather, testing is useful to the extent it forms a critical link to subsequent 
medical or public health interventions. Such interventions might be individual 
level, like better diagnosis, treatment, isolation, or quarantine of contacts. 
They might aid surveillance to understand levels and trends of disease within a 
defined population that enables informed decisions to implement or relax social 
distancing measures. In this article, we describe the range of available 
COVID-19 tests; their accuracy and timing considerations; and the specific 
clinical, organizational, and public health considerations that warrant 
different testing strategies. Three representative clinical scenarios illustrate 
the importance of appropriate test use and interpretation. The reason a patient 
seeks testing is often a strong indicator of the pretest probability of 
infection, and thus how to interpret test results. In addition, the level of 
population spread of the virus and the timing of testing play critical roles in 
the positive or negative predictive value of the test. We conclude with 
practical recommendations regarding the need for testing in various contexts, 
appropriate tests and testing methods, and the interpretation of test results.

As one of the major approaches in combating the COVID-19 pandemics, the 
availability of specific and reliable assays for the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome and 
its proteins is essential to identify the infection in suspected populations, 
make diagnoses in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals, and determine 
clearance of the virus after the infection. For these purposes, use of the 
quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for 
detection of the viral nucleic acid remains the most valuable in terms of its 
specificity, fast turn-around, high-throughput capacity, and reliability. It is 
critical to update the sequences of primers and probes to ensure the detection 
of newly emerged variants. Various assays for increased levels of IgG or IgM 
antibodies are available for detecting ongoing or past infection, vaccination 
responses, and persistence and for identifying high titers of neutralizing 
antibodies in recovered individuals. Viral genome sequencing is increasingly 
used for tracing infectious sources, monitoring mutations, and subtype 
classification and is less valuable in diagnosis because of its capacity and 
high cost. Nanopore target sequencing with portable options is available for a 
quick process for sequencing data. Emerging CRISPR-Cas-based assays, such as 
SHERLOCK and AIOD-CRISPR, for viral genome detection may offer options for 
prompt and point-of-care detection. Moreover, aptamer-based probes may be 
multifaceted for developing portable and high-throughput assays with fluorescent 
or chemiluminescent probes for viral proteins. In conclusion, assays are 
available for viral genome and protein detection, and the selection of specific 
assays depends on the purposes of prevention, diagnosis and pandemic control, or 
monitoring of vaccination efficacy.

BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to affect 
countries worldwide. To inhibit the transmission of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), testing of patients, contact tracing, and 
quarantine of their close contacts have been used as major nonpharmaceutical 
interventions. The advantages of antigen tests, such as low cost and rapid 
turnaround, may allow for the rapid identification of larger numbers of 
infectious persons. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy 
of antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Biomed Central 
databases from inception to January 2, 2021. Studies evaluating the diagnostic 
accuracy of antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 with reference standards were 
included. We included studies that provided sufficient data to construct a 2 × 2 
table on a per-patient basis. Only articles in English were reviewed. Summary 
sensitivity and specificity for antigen tests were generated using a 
random-effects model.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies with 8624 participants were included. The 
meta-analysis for antigen testing generated a pooled sensitivity of 79% (95% CI, 
66%-88%; 14 studies, 8624 patients) and a pooled specificity of 100% (95% CI, 
99%-100%; 14 studies, 8624 patients). The subgroup analysis of studies that 
reported specimen collection within 7 days after symptom onset showed a pooled 
sensitivity of 95% (95% CI, 78%-99%; four studies, 1342 patients) and pooled 
specificity of 100% (95% CI, 97%-100%; four studies, 1342 patients). Regarding 
the applicability, the patient selection, index tests, and reference standards 
of studies in our meta-analysis matched the review title.
CONCLUSION: Antigen tests have moderate sensitivity and high specificity for the 
detection of SARS-CoV-2. Antigen tests might have a higher sensitivity in 
detecting SARS-CoV-2 within 7 days after symptom onset. Based on our findings, 
antigen testing might be an effective method for identifying contagious 
individuals to block SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

Prompt diagnosis, patient isolation, and contact tracing are key measures to 
contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Molecular tests are the current 
gold standard for COVID-19 detection, but are carried out at central 
laboratories, delaying treatment and control decisions. Here we describe a 
portable assay system for rapid, onsite COVID-19 diagnosis. Termed CODA (CRISPR 
Optical Detection of Anisotropy), the method combined isothermal nucleic acid 
amplification, activation of CRISPR/Cas12a, and signal generation in a single 
assay, eliminating extra manual steps. Importantly, signal detection was based 
on the ratiometric measurement of fluorescent anisotropy, which allowed CODA to 
achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio. For point-of-care operation, we built a 
compact, standalone CODA device integrating optoelectronics, an embedded heater, 
and a microcontroller for data processing. The developed system completed 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection within 20 min of sample loading; the limit of detection 
reached 3 copy/μL. When applied to clinical samples (10 confirmed COVID-19 
patients; 10 controls), the rapid CODA test accurately classified COVID-19 
status, in concordance with gold-standard clinical diagnostics.

BACKGROUND: Currently, a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused 
by the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) is underway, resulting in high morbidity and mortality across the 
globe.
SUMMARY: A prompt and effective diagnosis is crucial to identify infected 
individuals, to monitor the infection, to perform contact tracing, and to limit 
the spread of the virus. Since the announcement of this public health emergency, 
several diagnostic methods have been developed including molecular and 
serological assays, and more recently biosensors. Here, we present the use of 
these assays as well as their main technical features, advantages, and limits. 
Key Messages: The development of reliable diagnostic assays is crucial not only 
for a correct diagnosis and containment of COVID-19 pandemic, but also for the 
decision-making process that is behind the clinical decisions, eventually 
contributing to the improvement of patient management. Furthermore, with the 
advent of vaccine and therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, 
serological assays will be instrumental for the validation of these new 
therapeutic options.

Serology is now a well-established diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 
infections in New Zealand. Using local and international experience, we provide 
an overview of serological response to infection and vaccination as well as the 
use and interpretation of antibody tests in our setting. We also discuss the 
potential future role of post-vaccination serology testing as a correlate of 
immunity. We conclude that, given the pitfalls of testing, clinical 
microbiologist advice is necessary for interpretation of high-consequence cases.

BACKGROUND: Before the emergence of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), vaccination reduced 
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from vaccinated persons who became infected, 
potentially by reducing viral loads. Although vaccination still lowers the risk 
of infection, similar viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons who are 
infected with the delta variant call into question the degree to which 
vaccination prevents transmission.
METHODS: We used contact-testing data from England to perform a retrospective 
observational cohort study involving adult contacts of SARS-CoV-2-infected adult 
index patients. We used multivariable Poisson regression to investigate 
associations between transmission and the vaccination status of index patients 
and contacts and to determine how these associations varied with the B.1.1.7 
(alpha) and delta variants and time since the second vaccination.
RESULTS: Among 146,243 tested contacts of 108,498 index patients, 54,667 (37%) 
had positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) tests. In index patients 
who became infected with the alpha variant, two vaccinations with either 
BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (also known as AZD1222), as compared with no 
vaccination, were independently associated with reduced PCR positivity in 
contacts (adjusted rate ratio with BNT162b2, 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.21 to 0.48; and with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.78). 
Vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of the delta variant were smaller 
than those with the alpha variant, and reductions in transmission of the delta 
variant after two BNT162b2 vaccinations were greater (adjusted rate ratio for 
the comparison with no vaccination, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.65) than after two 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinations (adjusted rate ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.82). 
Variation in cycle-threshold (Ct) values (indicative of viral load) in index 
patients explained 7 to 23% of vaccine-associated reductions in transmission of 
the two variants. The reductions in transmission of the delta variant declined 
over time after the second vaccination, reaching levels that were similar to 
those in unvaccinated persons by 12 weeks in index patients who had received 
ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and attenuating substantially in those who had received 
BNT162b2. Protection in contacts also declined in the 3-month period after the 
second vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination was associated with a smaller reduction in transmission 
of the delta variant than of the alpha variant, and the effects of vaccination 
decreased over time. PCR Ct values at diagnosis of the index patient only 
partially explained decreased transmission. (Funded by the U.K. Government

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is currently a serious global 
health threat. While conventional laboratory tests such as quantitative 
real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), serology tests, and chest 
computerized tomography (CT) scan allow diagnosis of COVID-19, these tests are 
time-consuming and laborious, and are limited in resource-limited settings or 
developing countries. Point-of-care (POC) biosensors such as chip-based and 
paper-based biosensors are typically rapid, portable, cost-effective, and 
user-friendly, which can be used for COVID-19 in remote settings. The escalating 
demand for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 presents a strong need for a timely and 
comprehensive review on the POC biosensors for COVID-19 that meet ASSURED 
criteria: Affordable, Sensitive, Specific, User-friendly, Rapid and Robust, 
Equipment-free, and Deliverable to end users. In the present review, we discuss 
the importance of rapid and early diagnosis of COVID-19 and pathogenesis of 
COVID-19 along with the key diagnostic biomarkers. We critically review the most 
recent advances in POC biosensors which show great promise for the detection of 
COVID-19 based on three main categories: chip-based biosensors, paper-based 
biosensors, and other biosensors. We subsequently discuss the key benefits of 
these biosensors and their use for the detection of antigen, antibody, and viral 
nucleic acids. The commercial POC biosensors for COVID-19 are critically 
compared. Finally, we discuss the key challenges and future perspectives of 
developing emerging POC biosensors for COVID-19. This review would be very 
useful for guiding strategies for developing and commercializing rapid POC tests 
to manage the spread of infections.Graphical abstract.

PURPOSE: The Mother and Child COVID-19 study is a cohort recruiting pregnant 
women and their children in Cantabria, North of Spain, during COVID-19 pandemic 
in order to ascertain consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pregnant women and 
their descendants. This article reports the cohort profile and preliminary 
results as recruitment is still open.
PARTICIPANTS: Three subcohorts can be identified at recruitment. Subcohort 1 
includes women giving birth between 23 March and 25 May 2020; they have been 
retrospectively recruited and could have been exposed to COVID-19 only in their 
third trimester of pregnancy. Subcohort 2 includes women giving birth from 26 
May 2020 on; they are being prospectively recruited and could have been exposed 
to COVID-19 in both their second and third trimesters of pregnancy. Subcohort 3 
includes women in their 12 week of pregnancy prospectively recruited from 26 May 
2020 on; they could have been exposed to COVID-19 anytime in their pregnancy. 
All women are being tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection using both RT-PCR for RNA 
detection and ELISA for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. All neonates are being 
tested for antibodies using immunochemoluminiscency tests; if the mother is 
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, a nasopharyngeal swab is also obtained from 
the child for RT-PCR analysis.
FINDINGS TO DATE: As of 22 October, 1167 women have been recruited (266, 354 and 
547 for subcohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively). Fourteen women tested positive to 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the day of delivery. All 14 children born from these women 
tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
FUTURE PLANS: Children from women included in subcohort 3 are expected to be 
recruited by the end of 2020. Children will be followed-up for 1 year in order 
to ascertain the effect that COVID-19 on their development.

ABSTARCT Four hundred and fifty-three SARS CoV-2 antibodies tests were conducted 
using Roche Elecsys® Anti SARS CoV-2 kits (detecting total antibodies) between 
June 13 to July 8, 2020 (25 days) on Cobas® e411 automatic analyser, based on 
electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) principle. Samples were collected 
from walk-in patients at our facility. Among them, 2 (0.4%) were found 
equivocal, 289 (63.8%) were found reactive, while 162 (35.8%) were found 
non-reactive. Moreover, reactive (symptomatic) cases were 262 (57.8%), reactive 
(asymptomatic) were 27 (6.0%), non-reactive (symptomatic) were 34 (7.5%), while 
non-reactive (asymptomatic) were 128 (28.3%). Most common symptom was fever, 
found in 262 (87.9%) individuals, followed by dry cough 146 (49.0%). Most number 
of reactive cases, i.e. 110 (42.6%) were those who got themselves tested between 
15-21 days after onset of first symptom. Key Words: COVID-19, Coronavirus, 
Antibodies testing.

Over the last 12-months during the pandemic caused by the severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) have issued public health instructions with the hope of 
mitigating the spread of the virus. Through existing relationships established 
by an academic hospital, we established weekly community conference calls to 
disseminate such critical information on the pandemic and allow community 
leaders to discuss struggles and successes. From these calls, we were able to 
collaborate in a more intimate manner with faith-based organizations, whereby we 
emphasized and planned the role they could undertake during the pandemic. Such 
emphasis was made between our medical institution and various faith-based 
organizations through meetings titled "Congregational COVID-19 Conversations." 
Over the past 12-months, we held virtual meetings with 38 faith-based 
organizations: 15 Christian congregations, 21 Jewish synagogues, and 2 Islamic 
masjids. We describe in detail in this report a narrative summary of the 
meetings. From these meetings, we discussed several COVID-19-related themes that 
included how to have their place of worship disseminate public health messaging, 
aid in preparing buildings for public worship, and insight into preparing their 
regions for aid in both COVID-19 testing and for potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 
sites. This medical-religious partnership has proven feasible and valuable 
during the pandemic and warrants emphasis in that it has the potential to serve 
a vital role in mitigating COVID-19-related disparities in certain communities, 
as well as potentially ending the COVID-19 pandemic completely.

COVID-19 is one of the most severe global health crises that humanity has ever 
faced. Researchers have restlessly focused on developing solutions for 
monitoring and tracing the viral culprit, SARS-CoV-2, as vital steps to break 
the chain of infection. Even though biomedical engineering (BME) is considered a 
rising field of medical sciences, it has demonstrated its pivotal role in 
nurturing the maturation of COVID-19 diagnostic technologies. Within a very 
short period of time, BME research applied to COVID-19 diagnosis has advanced 
with ever-increasing knowledge and inventions, especially in adapting available 
virus detection technologies into clinical practice and exploiting the power of 
interdisciplinary research to design novel diagnostic tools or improve the 
detection efficiency. To assist the development of BME in COVID-19 diagnosis, 
this review highlights the most recent diagnostic approaches and evaluates the 
potential of each research direction in the context of the pandemic.

The current reliable recommended test for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
diagnosis is quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR). Rapid antigen test devices could be useful as they are less 
expensive, faster without the need of specialized laboratories to perform the 
test. We report the performances of two rapid immunochromatographic antigen 
testing devices compared with RT-qPCR for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection in nasopharyngeal samples. We carried out a 
lateral-flow tests study on 401 nasopharyngeal swab samples from nonduplicated 
suspected COVID-19 subjects. An equal volume of universal transport medium 
tubes-containing samples (dilution ratio = 1:15) were added to the 
manufacturer's extraction buffer solution (dilution ratio = 1:2) and analyzed on 
BioSpeedia COVID19Speed-Antigen Test and on Abbott Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid 
Test, devices. Qualitative results were compared to those obtained by the 
RT-qPCR (Allplex™ SARS-CoV-2 Assay Seegene). Based on our data, the overall 
sensitivity for BioSpeedia and Panbio devices was estimated at 65.5% and 75.0%, 
respectively. The sensitivity was greater for cycle threshold values less than 
25 achieving 90.4 and 96.8 for BioSpeedia and Panbio devices, respectively. A 
perfect specificity of 100.0% was observed for both devices.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sweeping the 
world since the end of 2019. The titer change of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 
needs to be further clarified, the clinical and preventive value of antibodies 
still needs to be further investigated. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) was established by coating with SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein and 
used to detect serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in coronavirus disease 2019 patients to evaluate 
the pattern of changes of antibodies. The specificity of the ELISA for detection 
SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG were 96% (144/150) and 100% (150/150), respectively. The 
sensitivity of ELISA was 100% (150/150) for IgM, and 99.3% (149/150) for IgG. 
SARS-CoV-2-SP-IgM and SP-IgG antibodies could be detected on Day 1 of 
hospitalization in 12.5% patients, and SP-IgM began to decrease after reaching 
its peak at around 22-28 days, and become negative at Month 3 in 30% patients 
and negative at Month 7 in 79% of these patients after onset; IgG reached its 
peak around Day 22-28 and kept at a high level within the longest observation 
period for 4 months, it dropped very sharply at 7 months. The positive rates of 
SP-IgM and SP-IgG were higher than those of reverse transcription-polymerase 
chain reaction on Day 7 and 4. The established indirect ELISA has good 
specificity and sensitivity. IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 appeared almost 
simultaneously in the early stage, and the level of IgG antibodies could not 
maintain a high plateau in the observation period of 7 months. Our data will 
help develop the diagnosis and vaccine of SARS-CoV-2.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a threat to the health of the global population. 
As the result of a global effort in the determination of origin, structure, and 
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, particularly such the variant of 
concern as Delta Variant and Omicron Variant, the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 
are deepening and the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing. 
Currently, AstraZeneca-Vaxzevria/SII-Covishield vaccine, Janssen-Ad26.COV2.S 
vaccine, Moderna-mRNA-1273 vaccine, Pfizer BioNTech-Comirnaty vaccine and 
Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine have been listed as WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) 
Qualified Vaccines by WHO. Because of the antigen escape caused by the mutation 
in variants, the effectiveness of vaccines, which are currently the main means 
of prevention and treatment, has been affected by varying degrees. Herein, we 
review the current status of mutations of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the different 
approaches used in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and COVID-19 vaccine 
effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 variants.

BACKGROUND: Accurate rapid diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection could 
contribute to clinical and public health strategies to manage the COVID-19 
pandemic. Point-of-care antigen and molecular tests to detect current infection 
could increase access to testing and early confirmation of cases, and expediate 
clinical and public health management decisions that may reduce transmission.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care antigen and 
molecular-based tests for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We consider 
accuracy separately in symptomatic and asymptomatic population groups.
SEARCH METHODS: Electronic searches of the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and 
the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern (which 
includes daily updates from PubMed and Embase and preprints from medRxiv and 
bioRxiv) were undertaken on 30 Sept 2020. We checked repositories of COVID-19 
publications and included independent evaluations from national reference 
laboratories, the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and the Diagnostics 
Global Health website to 16 Nov 2020. We did not apply language restrictions.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included studies of people with either suspected 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, known SARS-CoV-2 infection or known absence of infection, 
or those who were being screened for infection. We included test accuracy 
studies of any design that evaluated commercially produced, rapid antigen or 
molecular tests suitable for a point-of-care setting (minimal equipment, sample 
preparation, and biosafety requirements, with results within two hours of sample 
collection). We included all reference standards that define the presence or 
absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) tests and established diagnostic criteria).
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Studies were screened independently in duplicate 
with disagreements resolved by discussion with a third author. Study 
characteristics were extracted by one author and checked by a second; extraction 
of study results and assessments of risk of bias and applicability (made using 
the QUADAS-2 tool) were undertaken independently in duplicate. We present 
sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each test 
and pooled data using the bivariate model separately for antigen and 
molecular-based tests. We tabulated results by test manufacturer and compliance 
with manufacturer instructions for use and according to symptom status.
MAIN RESULTS: Seventy-eight study cohorts were included (described in 64 study 
reports, including 20 pre-prints), reporting results for 24,087 samples (7,415 
with confirmed SARS-CoV-2). Studies were mainly from Europe (n = 39) or North 
America (n = 20), and evaluated 16 antigen and five molecular assays. We 
considered risk of bias to be high in 29 (50%) studies because of participant 
selection; in 66 (85%) because of weaknesses in the reference standard for 
absence of infection; and in 29 (45%) for participant flow and timing. Studies 
of antigen tests were of a higher methodological quality compared to studies of 
molecular tests, particularly regarding the risk of bias for participant 
selection and the index test. Characteristics of participants in 35 (45%) 
studies differed from those in whom the test was intended to be used and the 
delivery of the index test in 39 (50%) studies differed from the way in which 
the test was intended to be used. Nearly all studies (97%) defined the presence 
or absence of SARS-CoV-2 based on a single RT-PCR result, and none included 
participants meeting case definitions for probable COVID-19. Antigen tests 
Forty-eight studies reported 58 evaluations of antigen tests. Estimates of 
sensitivity varied considerably between studies. There were differences between 
symptomatic (72.0%, 95% CI 63.7% to 79.0%; 37 evaluations; 15530 samples, 4410 
cases) and asymptomatic participants (58.1%, 95% CI 40.2% to 74.1%; 12 
evaluations; 1581 samples, 295 cases). Average sensitivity was higher in the 
first week after symptom onset (78.3%, 95% CI 71.1% to 84.1%; 26 evaluations; 
5769 samples, 2320 cases) than in the second week of symptoms (51.0%, 95% CI 
40.8% to 61.0%; 22 evaluations; 935 samples, 692 cases). Sensitivity was high in 
those with cycle threshold (Ct) values on PCR ≤25 (94.5%, 95% CI 91.0% to 96.7%; 
36 evaluations; 2613 cases) compared to those with Ct values >25 (40.7%, 95% CI 
31.8% to 50.3%; 36 evaluations; 2632 cases). Sensitivity varied between brands. 
Using data from instructions for use (IFU) compliant evaluations in symptomatic 
participants, summary sensitivities ranged from 34.1% (95% CI 29.7% to 38.8%; 
Coris Bioconcept) to 88.1% (95% CI 84.2% to 91.1%; SD Biosensor STANDARD Q). 
Average specificities were high in symptomatic and asymptomatic participants, 
and for most brands (overall summary specificity 99.6%, 95% CI 99.0% to 99.8%). 
At 5% prevalence using data for the most sensitive assays in symptomatic people 
(SD Biosensor STANDARD Q and Abbott Panbio), positive predictive values (PPVs) 
of 84% to 90% mean that between 1 in 10 and 1 in 6 positive results will be a 
false positive, and between 1 in 4 and 1 in 8 cases will be missed. At 0.5% 
prevalence applying the same tests in asymptomatic people would result in PPVs 
of 11% to 28% meaning that between 7 in 10 and 9 in 10 positive results will be 
false positives, and between 1 in 2 and 1 in 3 cases will be missed. No studies 
assessed the accuracy of repeated lateral flow testing or self-testing. Rapid 
molecular assays Thirty studies reported 33 evaluations of five different rapid 
molecular tests. Sensitivities varied according to test brand. Most of the data 
relate to the ID NOW and Xpert Xpress assays. Using data from evaluations 
following the manufacturer's instructions for use, the average sensitivity of ID 
NOW was 73.0% (95% CI 66.8% to 78.4%) and average specificity 99.7% (95% CI 
98.7% to 99.9%; 4 evaluations; 812 samples, 222 cases). For Xpert Xpress, the 
average sensitivity was 100% (95% CI 88.1% to 100%) and average specificity 
97.2% (95% CI 89.4% to 99.3%; 2 evaluations; 100 samples, 29 cases). 
Insufficient data were available to investigate the effect of symptom status or 
time after symptom onset.
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Antigen tests vary in sensitivity. In people with signs 
and symptoms of COVID-19, sensitivities are highest in the first week of illness 
when viral loads are higher. The assays shown to meet appropriate criteria, such 
as WHO's priority target product profiles for COVID-19 diagnostics ('acceptable' 
sensitivity ≥ 80% and specificity ≥ 97%), can be considered as a replacement for 
laboratory-based RT-PCR when immediate decisions about patient care must be 
made, or where RT-PCR cannot be delivered in a timely manner. Positive 
predictive values suggest that confirmatory testing of those with positive 
results may be considered in low prevalence settings. Due to the variable 
sensitivity of antigen tests, people who test negative may still be infected. 
Evidence for testing in asymptomatic cohorts was limited. Test accuracy studies 
cannot adequately assess the ability of antigen tests to differentiate those who 
are infectious and require isolation from those who pose no risk, as there is no 
reference standard for infectiousness. A small number of molecular tests showed 
high accuracy and may be suitable alternatives to RT-PCR. However, further 
evaluations of the tests in settings as they are intended to be used are 
required to fully establish performance in practice. Several important studies 
in asymptomatic individuals have been reported since the close of our search and 
will be incorporated at the next update of this review. Comparative studies of 
antigen tests in their intended use settings and according to test operator 
(including self-testing) are required.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread to 
nearly every corner of the globe, causing societal instability. The resultant 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) leads to fever, sore throat, cough, chest 
and muscle pain, dyspnoea, confusion, anosmia, ageusia and headache. These can 
progress to life-threatening respiratory insufficiency, also affecting the 
heart, kidney, liver and nervous systems. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
is often confused with that of influenza and seasonal upper respiratory tract 
viral infections. Due to available treatment strategies and required 
containments, rapid diagnosis is mandated. This Review brings clarity to the 
rapidly growing body of available and in-development diagnostic tests, including 
nanomaterial-based tools. It serves as a resource guide for scientists, 
physicians, students and the public at large.

The outbreak of 2019-novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, 
started in late 2019; in a short time, it has spread rapidly all over the world. 
Although some possible antiviral and anti-inflammatory medications are 
available, thousands of people are dying daily. Well-understanding of the 
SARS-CoV-2 genome is not only essential for the development of new 
treatments/vaccines, but it also can be used for improving the sensitivity and 
specificity of current approaches for virus detection. Accordingly, we reviewed 
the most critical findings related to the genetics of the SARS-CoV-2, with a 
specific focus on genetic diversity and reported mutations, molecular-based 
diagnosis assays, using interfering RNA technology for the treatment of 
patients, and genetic-related vaccination strategies. Additionally, considering 
the unanswered questions or uncertainties in these regards, different topics 
were discussed.

The outbreak of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus has highlighted the challenges of 
detecting viral infections, especially in resource-limited settings. The 
SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission chain is interrupted when screening and diagnosis 
can be performed on a large scale by identifying asymptomatic or moderately 
symptomatic patients. Diagnosis of COVID-19 with reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been limited due to inadequate access to 
complex, expensive equipment and reagents, which has impeded efforts to reduce 
the spread of virus transmission. Recently, the development of several 
diagnostic platforms based on the CRISPR-Cas system has reduced the dependence 
on RT-PCR. The first CRISPR-based diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 was recently 
approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The biosensing systems have 
several important features that make them suitable for point-of-care tests, 
including the speed of design and synthesis of each platform in less than a few 
days, an assay time of 1-2 h, and the cost of materials and reagents less than 
one dollar per test. The HUDSON-SHERLOCK and STOPCovid biosensing systems, as 
field-deployable and rapid diagnostic tests, can detect low-copy viruses in body 
fluids without nucleic acid extraction and with minimal equipment. In addition, 
Cas13-based treatment strategies could potentially be an effective antiviral 
strategy for the prevention and treatment of emerging pandemic viruses such as 
SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we describe recent advances in CRISPR-based 
diagnostic platforms with an emphasis on their use in the rapid diagnosis and 
potential treatment of COVID-19.

SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) is a novel virus that has caused over 28 million cases 
worldwide and over 900,000 deaths since early 2020, rightfully being classified 
as a pandemic. COVID-19 is diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction testing which 
looks at cycle threshold (CT) values of two genes, N2 and E. This study examined 
CT values of COVID-positive patients at the VA hospital in Reno as well as other 
lab values and comorbidities to determine if any could aid clinicians in 
predicting the need for hospitalization and higher levels of care. Multiple 
variables, including N2 CT value, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), D-dimer, 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and ferritin 
were evaluated for potential associations with N2 CT value as well as required 
level of care (based on World Health Organization [WHO] ordinal score). The 
results suggest that patients with a N2 CT value less than 34 are four times 
more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p = .0021) while controlling for 
age and comorbidities (DM, cardiac, kidney, and lung disease). Patients of age 
55 or greater were 15.18 times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 
(p = .012) controlling for N2 CT value and comorbidities. Furthermore, patients 
with ALC less than 1 were 5.88 times more likely to have WHO ordinal score of 
4-8 (p = .00024). N2 CT values also appear to be associated with many commonly 
obtained markers such as ALC, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and 
D-dimer. Patients with N2 CT values less than 34 were 3.49 times more likely to 
have ALC values less than 1, controlling for age and comorbidities (p = .0072) 
while patients 55 or older were 6.66 times more likely to have ALC less than 1 
(p = .027). Finally, this study confirms previous conclusions that patients with 
advanced age had more severe infections and thus will likely require higher 
levels of care.

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to be a global concern, with over 
150 million cases worldwide. Arizona, which was recently a hotspot for COVID-19, 
has over 860 thousand cases. Reviewing the COVID-19 trends over time is crucial 
in understanding the pandemic and evaluating the impact of mitigation 
techniques. This current study analyzes the trends in COVID-19 testing and 
positivity rates from a mobile testing program in the Phoenix metropolitan area 
between December 2020 and April 2021. Of the 32,234 tests performed there was a 
total of 3654 COVID positive cases, yielding an overall positivity rate of 
11.3%. COVID-19 positivity rates were significantly higher in December (12.9%) 
and January (12.7%), compared to February (7.5%), March (4.9%), and April 
(6.7%), p < 0.05. The peak of COVID-19 cases is likely attributable to the 
holiday season and family gatherings, followed by a steady decline, likely due 
to fewer gatherings and an increase in individuals receiving the COVID-19 
vaccines. Continued public health measures, including vaccinations, are critical 
in reducing COVID-19 transmission.

Detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins is commercially available in the form of 
lateral-flow rapid antigen test for the point-of-care diagnosis of COVID-19. 
This platform has been validated for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, 
for diagnosis or screening, and as part of single or sequential diagnostic 
strategies. Although in general less sensitive than amplification techniques, 
antigen tests may be particularly valid during the first days of symptoms and to 
detect individuals with greater viral load, thereby with enhanced chances of 
viral transmission. The simplicity of antigen tests make them very suitable to 
discard infection in settings with low pretest probability, and to detect 
infection in case of higher chances of having COVID-19.

Electrochemical biosensors combine the selectivity of electrochemical signal 
transducers with the specificity of biomolecular recognition strategies. 
Although they have been broadly studied in different areas of diagnostics, they 
are not yet fully commercialized. During the COVID-19 pandemic, electrochemical 
platforms have shown the potential to address significant limitations of 
conventional diagnostic platforms, including accuracy, affordability, and 
portability. The advantages of electrochemical platforms make them a strong 
candidate for rapid point-of-care detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection by targeting 
not only viral RNA but antigens and antibodies. Herein, we reviewed advancements 
in electrochemical biosensing platforms towards the detection of SARS-CoV-2 
through studying similar viruses.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19), a disease caused by infection 
with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a 
global pandemic. Diagnosis is critical and diagnostic techniques include reverse 
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), serologic antibody testing, 
and chest computed tomography (CT). Despite rigorous meta-analyses looking into 
these techniques, there is no summary and additionally no algorithm to help 
guide diagnostic testing. Our objective is to perform a systematic review of the 
literature and to provide evidence-based algorithms for diagnosing or ruling out 
COVID-19.
METHODS: Data were gathered using PubMed and Ovid research databases using a 
predefined medical subject heading (MeSH) based search, and sources that were 
included in the study had their references reviewed to screen for more sources 
for this study. Sources were collected up to 23 August 2020. Two researchers 
searched through the databases for articles and data/articles meeting inclusion 
criteria were extracted.
RESULTS: 395 articles were identified, and 10 studies were included. 
Meta-analyses of diagnostic tests were included in our systematic review. An 
overview was then provided for each diagnostic test. Sensitivities and 
specificities for RT-PCR, serologic antibody tests and chest CT were collected, 
and the data was stratified by categorical variables. Two evidence-based 
algorithms were developed for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the 
hospitalized and ambulatory settings.
CONCLUSIONS: This article provides a summary of the up-to-date efficacy of the 
most utilized diagnostic tests currently available for COVID-19. Additionally, 
this article provides evidence-based COVID-19 diagnostic algorithms for 
symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the hospitalized and ambulatory 
settings.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus, 
SARS-CoV-2, has infected more than 50.6 million individuals and caused over 1.2 
million deaths globally, raising a major health concern. To date, no specific 
antiviral treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 has been approved by the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA). Highly sensitive and specific laboratory diagnostics 
are therefore critical for controlling the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic 
and optimizing clinical care, infection control, and public health 
interventions. The FDA has issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for hundreds 
of COVID-19 diagnostic tests of different classes. Whereas nucleic acid testing 
(NAT) such as RT-PCR remains the criterion standard for COVID-19 diagnosis, 
serological antibody and antigen tests are increasingly being developed. Tests 
based on the novel RNA sensing techniques (e.g., SHERLOCK, DETECTR, and Toehold 
Switch) are promising due to their relatively low cost, high accuracy, and rapid 
detection time. Diagnostic testing results for SARS-CoV-2 should be interpreted 
with caution, since they depend heavily on factors such as viral load, virus 
replication, the source and timing of sample collection, sample extraction, and 
characteristics of various testing methods. This review aims to present the 
current status of common diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, review the 
current regulatory requirements, and identify future directions in the 
development of improved diagnostics that are more accurate, accessible, and 
rapid.

Asymptomatic COVID-19 with ambiguous test results.

[Article in English, Norwegian]

Norheim AJ, Lind A, Taxt AM, Nakstad ER, Borud EK, Waldow T.

BACKGROUND: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is a significant part of the effort to combat the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Mass testing of healthy individuals raises several issues, 
however, and the results can be challenging to interpret.
CASE PRESENTATION: A healthy 19-year-old man entered the military after two 
weeks of quarantine. The recruit had no respiratory symptoms or fever before, 
during or after his enrolment, and no history of SARS-CoV-2 exposure. At 
enrolment, he had a positive rapid test and a venous blood sample showed 
antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. PCR tests of specimens obtained from the upper 
respiratory tract were negative at enrolment and at week three, but were 
positive at week six.
INTERPRETATION: The overall assessment of all the tests indicates a probable 
asymptomatic infection. This case report illustrates the challenge of 
interpreting screening results in asymptomatic individuals.

Neglected rural communities in Latin America are highly vulnerable to COVID-19 
due to a poor health infrastructure and limited access to severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnosis. Manabí is a province 
of the Coastal Region of Ecuador characterized by a high prevalence of rural 
population living under poverty conditions. In the current study, we present the 
retrospective analysis of the results of a massive SARS-CoV-2 testing operation 
in nonhospitalized populations from Manabí carried out from August to September 
2020. A total of 4,003 people from 15 cantons were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by 
reverse-transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction, resulting in an 
overall infection rate of 16.13% for SARS-CoV-2, with several communities > 30%. 
Moreover, 29 SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader community-dwelling individuals with viral 
loads above 108 copies/mL were found. These results support that uncontrolled 
COVID-19 community transmission was happening in Manabí during the first 
semester of COVID-19 pandemic. This report endorses the utility of massive 
SARS-CoV-2 testing among asymptomatic population for control and surveillance of 
COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is well known as a fatal 
disease, first discovered at Wuhan in China, ranging from mild to death, such as 
shortness of breath and fever. Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is a crucial point in 
preventing global prevalence.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic competency and efficiency with 
the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay kit and the Dr. PCR 20 K COVID-19 Detection kit, 
designed based on the qRT-PCR and dPCR technologies, respectively.
METHODS: A total of 30 negative and 20 COVID-19 positive specimens were assigned 
to the diagnostic test by using different COVID-19 diagnosis kits. Diagnostic 
accuracy was measured by statistical testing with sensitivity, specificity, and 
co-efficiency calculations.
RESULTS: Comparing both diagnostic kits, we confirmed that the diagnostic 
results of 30 negative and 20 positive cases were the same pre-diagnostic 
results. The diagnostic statistics test results were perfectly matched with 
value (1). Cohen's Kappa coefficient was demonstrated that the given kits in two 
different ways were "almost perfect" with value (1). In evaluating the detection 
capability, the dilutional linearity experiments substantiate that the Dr. PCR 
20 K COVID-19 Detection kit could detect SARS-CoV-2 viral load at a 
concentration ten times lower than that of the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay kit.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we propose that the dPCR diagnosis using LOAA dPCR 
could be a powerful method for COVID-19 point-of-care tests requiring immediate 
diagnosis in a limited time and space through the advantages of relatively low 
sample concentration and small equipment size compared to conventional qRT-PCR.

Petroleum jelly and COVID-19 prevention.

Yaghmouri P, Abdolahi A, Sedighiani F.

Since the ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had a 
significant impact on public health and, also the clinical benefits of the 
medications are so limited, preventive measures may be able to help control its 
spread. Because the petroleum jelly compound could alter the physicochemical 
properties that affect adhesion, we investigated the preventive role of 
Petroleum jelly on covid-19 infection. Forty people with no sign and no history 
of covid-19 infection, were included in this study. They use petroleum jelly 
(Vaseline) nasally twice a day for about two months. After that time, 
participants tested by RT-qPCR to determine any infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
There was a significant difference in terms of RT-qPCR results between the 
intervention and control groups. Petroleum jelly may be effective in preventing 
covid-19 infection (Tab. 2, Fig. 1, Ref. 13). Keywords: COVID-19, pandemic, 
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, public health.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to infection by a new human 
coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has 
seriously disrupted the provision of oncology services and their uptake. 
Antibody testing, both at an individual level and of populations, has been 
widely viewed to be a key activity for guiding the options for treatment of 
high-risk individuals, as well as the implementation of safe control of 
infection measures. Ideally, the detection of a specific antibody should signify 
that all individuals tested have been infected by SARS-CoV-2 and that in the 
case of specific IgG that they are immune to further infection. This would 
enable SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to be appropriately managed and 
healthcare workers shown to be immune to return to work where they would no 
longer pose a risk to their patients or be at risk themselves. Unfortunately, 
this is not the case for COVID-19, where it has been shown that immunity may not 
be protective, and seroconversion delayed or absent. The variability in antibody 
test performance, particularly that of lateral flow assays, has caused confusion 
for the public and healthcare professions alike. Many antibody test devices have 
been made available without independent evaluations and these may lack both 
adequate sensitivity and specificity. This review seeks to educate healthcare 
workers, particularly those working in oncology, of the current benefits and 
limitations of SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing.

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 Indoor Test™ by Phylagen uses a real-time PCR Assay to 
detect nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, which is 
extracted from swabs sampled from environmental surfaces. This information can 
be used to detect the presence of the virus in indoor environments.
OBJECTIVE: To validate the COVID-19 Indoor TestTM by Phylagen as part of the 
AOAC Research Institute's Emergency Response Validation Performance Tested 
Method(s)SM program.
METHOD: The COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen assay was evaluated for specificity 
using in silico analysis of 15 764 SARS-CoV-2 sequences and 65 exclusivity 
organisms. The candidate method was also evaluated in an unpaired matrix study 
design for one environmental surface (stainless steel) and compared to the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 
Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (Revision 4, Effective 6/12/2020).
RESULTS: Results of the in silico analysis demonstrated the specificity of the 
method in being able to detect SARS-CoV-2 target sequences and discriminate them 
from near-neighbors. In the matrix study, the candidate method demonstrated 
statistically significant better recovery of the target analyte than the 
reference method (2 × 103 GU/2 × 2" test surface).
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen is a rapid and accurate method 
that can be utilized to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent 
of COVID-19, on stainless-steel surfaces in built environments.
HIGHLIGHTS: The COVID-19 Indoor Test by Phylagen assay performed significantly 
better than the reference method when used to detect SARS-CoV-2 from 
environmental surfaces.

The on-going global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a 
novel coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) has been underway for about 11 months. Through November 20, 2020, 
51 detection kits for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids (24 kits), antibodies (25 kits), 
or antigens (2 kits) have been approved by the National Medical Products 
Administration of China (NMPA). Convenient and reliable SARS-CoV-2 detection 
assays are urgently needed worldwide for strategic control of the pandemic. In 
this review, the detection kits approved in China are summarised and the three 
types of tests, namely nucleic acid, serological and antigen detection, which 
are available for the detection of COVID-19 are discussed in detail. The 
development of novel detection kits will lay the foundation for the control and 
prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic globally.

Adaptive immune responses play critical roles in viral clearance and protection 
against re-infection, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. What is exceptional is the 
rapid characterization of the immune response to the virus performed by 
researchers during the first 20 months of the pandemic. This has given us a more 
detailed understanding of SARS-CoV-2 compared to many viruses that have been 
with us for a long time. Furthermore, effective COVID-19 vaccines were developed 
in record time, and their rollout worldwide is already making a significant 
difference, although major challenges remain in terms of equal access. The 
pandemic has engaged scientists and the public alike, and terms such as 
seroprevalence, neutralizing antibodies, antibody escape and vaccine 
certificates have become familiar to a broad community. Here, we review key 
findings concerning B cell and antibody (Ab) responses to SARS-CoV-2, focusing 
on non-severe cases and anti-spike (S) Ab responses in particular, the latter 
being central to protective immunity induced by infection or vaccination. The 
emergence of viral variants that have acquired mutations in S acutely highlights 
the need for continued characterization of both emerging variants and Ab 
responses against these during the evolving pathogen-immune system arms race.

Since December 2019, there had been an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). Pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) is prevalent around the world, and the number of infected cases has 
increased rapidly. Viral nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 can provide direct 
evidence for rapid diagnosis, disease course monitoring, and therapeutic 
efficacy. However, in practice, false-negative results in nucleic acid test are 
common, causing missed diagnoses, which are not conducive to the prevention and 
control of this outbreak. This article analyzes the possible causes and proposed 
measures to reduce the false-negative rate of nucleic acid test results and more 
effectively curb the outbreak.

Of the 47 prefectures in Japan, Iwate had the fewest cases of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19), with the first diagnosis officially confirmed on July 
28, 2020. A baseline serological survey of COVID-19 antibodies is essential to 
accurately evaluate an epidemic outbreak. The primary purpose of this study was 
to determine pre-epidemic prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among healthcare 
workers, using two laboratory-based quantitative tests. In addition, a 
point-of-care (POC) qualitative test, rapid, simple, and convenient for primary 
care clinics, was compared with the laboratory-based tests. All antibody tests 
were performed on serum from 1,000 healthcare workers (mean age, 40 ± 11 years) 
in Iwate Prefectural Central Hospital, May 29-31, 2020. A COVID-19 case was 
defined as showing positive results in both laboratory-based quantitative tests. 
None of 1,000 samples had positive results in both of the laboratory 
immunoassays. The POC test showed positive results in 33 of 1,000 samples (3.3%) 
(95% confidence interval:2.19-4.41), but no samples were simultaneously positive 
in both laboratory-based tests. In conclusion, COVID-19 cases were not 
serologically confirmed by a baseline control study of healthcare workers at our 
hospital in late May, 2020. Moreover, the POC qualitative test may offer no 
advantage in areas with very low prevalence of COVID-19, due to higher 
false-positive reactions compared with laboratory-based quantitative 
immunoassays.

INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 disease can affect women at any stage of pregnancy, and 
newborns could become infected with SARS-CoV-2 through vertical or horizontal 
transmission.
OBJECTIVE: To determine clinical and epidemiological characteristics of mothers 
with COVID-19, associated neonatal outcomes, and to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 vertical 
transmission.
METHODS: We conducted an observational, descriptive, cross-sectional study. We 
included all mothers with positive serology for SARS-CoV-2 and their newborns at 
the Hospital Regional Docente de Trujillo from April 18 to September 30, 2020. 
Variables were collected from the medical records, and descriptive statistics 
were used for the analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 647 mothers and 656 neonates were enrolled. Of all live 
births, 85.3% and 14.7% were term and preterm neonates, respectively. We found 
1.7% (11/656) of newborns with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2; and that 27.3% 
(3/11) of these neonates required hospitalization. Neonatal mortality was 4/656 
(0.6%), and no case was attributed to COVID-19. Of all mothers affected with 
COVID-19, 95.7% were asymptomatic, and 4.3% presented clinical symptoms 
attributed to COVID-19, most of which were mild. The most frequent obstetric 
complications were preeclampsia-eclampsia, prelabour rupture of membranes, and 
acute fetal distress. All the mothers were discharged.
CONCLUSION: We found 1.7% of newborns with positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; 
and that 20.1% of these neonates were hospitalized. The most frequent morbidity 
was neonatal sepsis and prematurity. The infection was mild among newborns, 
showing a 0.6% overall mortality, with no cases attributed to COVID-19. We found 
that only 5% of mothers presented symptoms, most of which were mild to moderate 
symptoms. There was no record of maternal mortality in this study group. It is 
not possible to conclude whether vertical transmission or intrapartum-acquired 
infection is responsible for neonatal COVID-19 infections.

Publisher: INTRODUCCIÓN: La enfermedad de COVID-19 puede afectar a gestantes en 
cualquier trimestre del embarazo. Por su parte, los neonatos podrían infectarse 
con SARS-CoV-2 por transmisión vertical u horizontal.
OBJETIVO: Determinar las características clínicas y epidemiológicas de madres 
con COVID-19, de sus neonatos y la transmisión vertical del SARS-CoV-2.
MÉTODOS: Estudio observacional, descriptivo, transversal. Se incluyeron todas 
las madres con serología positiva para SARS-CoV-2 y sus neonatos nacidos en el 
Hospital Regional Docente de Trujillo desde el 18 de abril hasta el 30 de 
septiembre de 2020. La información para las variables se recogió de las 
historias clínicas. Para el análisis se usó estadística descriptiva.
RESULTADOS: Participaron 647 madres y 656 neonatos. El 85,3% de los neonatos 
nació de término y el 14,7% fue prematuro. El 1,7% (11/656) tuvieron PCR-RT 
positivos para SARS-CoV-2, y de ellos el 27,3% (3/11) requirió hospitalizados. 
La mortalidad fue de 4/656 (0,6%), no atribuida a COVID-19. De las madres 
afectadas con COVID-19, 95,7% fue asintomática, el 4,3% presentó sintomatología 
clínica atribuida a COVID-19, siendo en su mayoría casos leves. Las 
complicaciones obstétricas más frecuentes fueron preeclampsia, eclampsia, rotura 
prematura de las membranas y sufrimiento fetal agudo. Todas las madres fueron 
dadas de alta.
CONCLUSIÓN: De los neonatos estudiados, el 1,7% presentó prueba PCR-RT para 
SARS-CoV-2 positiva. El 20,1% fue hospitalizado. La morbilidad más frecuente fue 
sepsis neonatal y prematuridad. La mortalidad fue de 0,6%, ningún caso atribuido 
a COVID-19. El cuadro clínico de esta patología fue leve en los neonatos. El 95% 
de las madres con COVID-19 fueron asintomáticas. De las gestantes que 
presentaron cuadro clínico, tuvieron sintomatología leve a moderada. No se tuvo 
registro de mortalidad materna en el grupo de estudio. No se puede concluir si 
se trata de casos de transmisión vertical del SARS-CoV-2 o estamos frente a 
casos de posible infección neonatal adquirida intraparto.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the percentage of positivity of close contacts of 
coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) patients to depict the importance of 
asymptomatic infections in the patient-to-patient transmission of COVID-19.
METHODS: One hundred subjects were included. Nineteen index COVID-19 cases and 
81 traced close contacts were screened for coronavirus 2 of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunoglobulin M and G against 
SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by rapid test.
RESULTS: Thirty-four (42%) contacts in the study were positive for SARS-CoV-2. 
Twenty-three (67.6%) manifested less than 2 respiratory symptoms, and 5 (14.7%) 
remained asymptomatic. The average of positive contacts by index COVID-19 case 
(R0) was 4.3 and the mean of time of positive COVID-19 test at sampling time was 
18.9 days. Positive antibody test against SARS-CoV-2 was observed in 16% of the 
participants.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of close contacts of COVID-19 patients infected with 
SARS-CoV-2 (42%) and with less than 2 or with no respiratory symptoms (82.4%) 
was high in the study population. A low proportion of COVID-19 patients had a 
positive test for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The screening for SARS-CoV-2 in 
close contacts of COVID-19 positive patients should be encouraged to avoid 
spreading the infection and the expansion of the disease.

BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in older adults living in 
long-term care facilities is uncertain. We investigated the protective effect of 
the first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca non-replicating viral-vectored vaccine 
(ChAdOx1 nCoV-19; AZD1222) and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA-based vaccine (BNT162b2) 
in residents of long-term care facilities in terms of PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
infection over time since vaccination.
METHODS: The VIVALDI study is a prospective cohort study that commenced 
recruitment on June 11, 2020, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, infection 
outcomes, and immunity in residents and staff in long-term care facilities in 
England that provide residential or nursing care for adults aged 65 years and 
older. In this cohort study, we included long-term care facility residents 
undergoing routine asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 testing between Dec 8, 2020 (the date 
the vaccine was first deployed in a long-term care facility), and March 15, 
2021, using national testing data linked within the COVID-19 Datastore. Using 
Cox proportional hazards regression, we estimated the relative hazard of 
PCR-positive infection at 0-6 days, 7-13 days, 14-20 days, 21-27 days, 28-34 
days, 35-48 days, and 49 days and beyond after vaccination, comparing 
unvaccinated and vaccinated person-time from the same cohort of residents, 
adjusting for age, sex, previous infection, local SARS-CoV-2 incidence, 
long-term care facility bed capacity, and clustering by long-term care facility. 
We also compared mean PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values for positive swabs 
obtained before and after vaccination. The study is registered with ISRCTN, 
number 14447421.
FINDINGS: 10 412 care home residents aged 65 years and older from 310 LTCFs were 
included in this analysis. The median participant age was 86 years (IQR 80-91), 
7247 (69·6%) of 10 412 residents were female, and 1155 residents (11·1%) had 
evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. 9160 (88·0%) residents received at 
least one vaccine dose, of whom 6138 (67·0%) received ChAdOx1 and 3022 (33·0%) 
received BNT162b2. Between Dec 8, 2020, and March 15, 2021, there were 36 352 
PCR results in 670 628 person-days, and 1335 PCR-positive infections (713 in 
unvaccinated residents and 612 in vaccinated residents) were included. Adjusted 
hazard ratios (HRs) for PCR-positive infection relative to unvaccinated 
residents declined from 28 days after the first vaccine dose to 0·44 (95% CI 
0·24-0·81) at 28-34 days and 0·38 (0·19-0·77) at 35-48 days. Similar effect 
sizes were seen for ChAdOx1 (adjusted HR 0·32, 95% CI 0·15-0·66) and BNT162b2 
(0·35, 0·17-0·71) vaccines at 35-48 days. Mean PCR Ct values were higher for 
infections that occurred at least 28 days after vaccination than for those 
occurring before vaccination (31·3 [SD 8·7] in 107 PCR-positive tests vs 26·6 
[6·6] in 552 PCR-positive tests; p<0·0001).
INTERPRETATION: Single-dose vaccination with BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 vaccines 
provides substantial protection against infection in older adults from 4-7 weeks 
after vaccination and might reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the risk of 
infection is not eliminated, highlighting the ongoing need for 
non-pharmaceutical interventions to prevent transmission in long-term care 
facilities.

BACKGROUND: Salivary detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been proposed as an alternative to nasopharyngeal or 
oropharyngeal swab testing. Our group previously published a study demonstrating 
that both testing methods identified SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR)-based detection methodology. We therefore conducted a follow-up study 
using antibody testing to evaluate the accuracy of saliva versus swabs for 
COVID-19 detection and the durability of antibody response.
METHODS: Venous blood samples were collected from consenting participants and 
the presence of serum antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated on a large, 
automated immunoassay platform by the Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 qualitative assay 
(Roche Diagnostics, Laval Quebec). Individuals with a serum antibody cut-off 
index (COI) ≥ 1.0 were considered positive.
RESULTS: In asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients with a previously 
positive standard swab and/or saliva SARS-CoV-2 PCR-test, 42 demonstrated 
antibodies with 13 patients positive by swab alone, and 8 patients positive by 
saliva alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite their status as 'current standard' for COVID-19 testing, 
these findings highlight limitations of PCR-based tests.

We describe the results of testing health care workers, from a tertiary care 
hospital in Japan that had experienced a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
outbreak during the first peak of the pandemic, for severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody seroconversion. Using two 
chemiluminescent immunoassays and a confirmatory surrogate virus neutralization 
test, serological testing revealed that a surprising 42% of overlooked COVID-19 
diagnoses (27/64 cases) occurred when case detection relied solely on SARS-CoV-2 
nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Our results suggest that the 
NAAT-positive population is only the tip of the iceberg and the portion left 
undetected might potentially have led to silent transmissions and triggered the 
spread. A questionnaire-based risk assessment was further indicative of 
exposures to specific aerosol-generating procedures (i.e., noninvasive 
ventilation and airway suctioning) having mediated transmission and served as 
the origins of the outbreak. Our observations are supportive of a multitiered 
testing approach, including the use of serological diagnostics, in order to 
accomplish exhaustive case detection along the whole COVID-19 spectrum. 
IMPORTANCE We describe the results of testing frontline health care workers, 
from a hospital in Japan that had experienced a COVID-19 outbreak, for 
SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Antibody testing revealed that a surprising 42% 
of overlooked COVID-19 diagnoses occurred when case detection relied solely on 
PCR-based viral detection. COVID-19 clusters have been continuously striking the 
health care system around the globe. Our findings illustrate that such clusters 
are lined with hidden infections eluding detection with diagnostic PCR and that 
the cluster burden in total is more immense than actually recognized. The 
mainstays of diagnosing infectious diseases, including COVID-19, generally 
consist of two approaches, one aiming to detect molecular fragments of the 
invading pathogen and the other to measure immune responses of the host. 
Considering antibody testing as one trustworthy option to test our way through 
the pandemic can aid in the exhaustive case detection of COVID-19 patients with 
variable presentations.

Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused a global pandemic. The majority of patients 
will experience mild disease, but others will develop a severe respiratory 
infection that requires hospitalisation. This is causing a significant strain on 
health services. Patients are presenting at emergency departments with symptoms 
of dyspnoea, dry cough and fever with varying severity. The appropriate triaging 
of patients will assist in preventing health services becoming overwhelmed 
during the pandemic. This is assisted through clinical assessment and various 
imaging and laboratory investigations, including chest X-ray, blood analysis and 
identification of viral infection with SARS-CoV-2. Here, a succinct triaging 
pathway that aims to be fast, reliable and affordable is presented. The hope is 
that such a pathway will assist health services in appropriately combating the 
pandemic.

The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) highlights the 
shortcomings of the current testing paradigm for viral disease diagnostics. 
Here, we report a stepwise protocol for an RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified 
colorimetric test for rapid and naked-eye molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. The 
test employs a unique dual-prong approach that integrates nucleic acid (NA) 
amplification and plasmonic sensing for point-of-care detection of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), with a sample-to-assay response 
time of <1 h. The RNA-extraction-free nano-amplified colorimetric test utilizes 
plasmonic gold nanoparticles capped with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) as a 
colorimetric reporter to detect the amplified nucleic acid from the COVID-19 
causative virus, SARS-CoV-2. The ASOs are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 N-gene, 
and binding of the ASOs to their target sequence results in the aggregation of 
the plasmonic gold nanoparticles. This highly specific agglomeration step leads 
to a change in the plasmonic response of the nanoparticles. Furthermore, when 
tested using clinical samples, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of the 
test were found to be >98.4%, >96.6% and 100%, respectively, with a detection 
limit of 10 copies/μL. The test can easily be adapted to diagnose other viral 
infections with a simple modification of the ASOs and primer sequences. It also 
provides a low-cost, rapid approach requiring minimal instrumentation that can 
be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 at point-of-care 
settings in resource-poor situations. The colorimetric readout of the test can 
even be monitored using a handheld optical reader to obtain a quantitative 
response. Therefore, we anticipate that this protocol will be widely useful for 
the development of biosensors for the molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 and 
other infectious diseases.

Large public-health training events may result in severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. Universal SARS-CoV-2 testing 
during trainings for the Uganda Population-based HIV Impact Assessment 
identified 28 of 475 (5.9%) individuals with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
among attendees; most (89.3%) were asymptomatic. Until COVID-19 vaccine is 
readily available for staff and participants, effective COVID-19 mitigation 
measures, along with SARS-CoV-2 testing, are recommended for in-person 
trainings, particularly when trainees will have subsequent contact with survey 
participants.

The outbreak and widely spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become 
a global public health concern. COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented and 
profound impact on the whole world, and the prevention and control of COVID-19 
is a global public health challenge remains to be solved. The retrospective 
analysis of the large scale tests of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may indicate some important 
information of this pandemic. We selected 12400 SARS-CoV-2 tests detected in 
Wuhan in the first semester of 2020 and made a systematic analysis of them, in 
order to find some beneficial clue for the consistent prevention and control of 
COVID-19.SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in suspected COVID-19 patients with 
real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The patients' features 
including gender, age, type of specimen, source of patients, and the dynamic 
changes of the clinical symptoms were recorded and statistically analyzed. 
Quantitative and qualitive statistical analysis were carried out after 
laboratory detection.The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 33.02% in 12,400 
suspected patients' specimens in Wuhan at the first months of COVID-19 
epidemics. SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test of nasopharyngeal swabs might produce 4.79% 
(594/12400) presumptive results. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 
significantly different between gender, age, type of specimen, source of 
patients, respectively (P < .05). The median window period from the occurrence 
of clinical symptom or close contact with COVID-19 patient to the first 
detection of positive PCR was 2 days (interquartile range, 1-4 days). The median 
interval time from the first SARS-CoV-2 positive to the turning negative was 
14 days (interquartile range, 8-19.25 days).This study reveals the comprehensive 
characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from multiple perspectives, and 
it provides important clues and may also supply useful suggestions for future 
work of the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.

As the COVID-19 epidemic is still ongoing, a more rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 
infection such as viral antigen-detection needs to be evaluated for early 
diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Here, we report the dynamic changes of SARS-CoV-2 
viral antigens in nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients and its association 
with the viral nucleic acid clearance and clinical outcomes. Eighty-five 
COVID-19 patients were enrolled for detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral antigens, 
including 57 anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative cases and 28 antibody positive 
cases. The viral antigen could be detected in 52.63% (30/57) patients with 
SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
especially in the first 5 days after disease onset (p = 0.0018) and disappeared 
in about 8 days after disease onset. Viral antigens were highly detectable in 
patients with low Ct value (less than 30) of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid RT-PCT 
assay, suggesting the expression of viral antigen was associated with high viral 
load. Furthermore, positive antigen detection indicated disease progression, 
nine cases with positive antigen (9/30, 30.0%), in contrast to two cases (2/27, 
7.40%) (p = 0.0444) with negative antigen, which progressed into severe disease. 
Thus, the viral antigens were persistent in early stages of infection when virus 
was in highly replicating status, and viral antigen detection promises to 
rapidly screen positive patients in the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has affected all aspects of 
human life. Rapid, accurate, sensitive and user friendly detection method is 
urgently needed to facilitate early intervention and control the spread of 
SARS-CoV-2. Here, we propose a one-pot visual SARS-CoV-2 detection system named 
"opvCRISPR" by integrating reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal 
amplification (RT-LAMP) and Cas12a cleavage in a single reaction system. We 
demonstrate that the collateral activity against single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 
reporters of activated Cas12a triggered by RT-LAMP amplicon increases detection 
sensitivity and makes detection results observable with naked eye. The opvCRISPR 
enables detection at nearly single molecule level in 45 min. We validate this 
method with 50 SARS-CoV-2 potentially infected clinical samples. The opvCRISPR 
diagnostic results provide 100% agreement with the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC)-approved quantitative RT-PCR assay. The opvCRISPR holds 
great potential for SARS-CoV-2 detection in next-generation point-of-care 
molecular diagnostics.

Serological rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are widely used across pathologies, 
often providing users a simple, binary result (positive or negative) in as 
little as 5 to 20 min. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, new RDTs 
for identifying SARS-CoV-2 have rapidly proliferated. However, these seemingly 
easy-to-read tests can be highly subjective, and interpretations of the visible 
"bands" of color that appear (or not) in a test window may vary between users, 
test models, and brands. We developed and evaluated the accuracy/performance of 
a smartphone application (xRCovid) that uses machine learning to classify 
SARS-CoV-2 serological RDT results and reduce reading ambiguities. Across 11 
COVID-19 RDT models, the app yielded 99.3% precision compared to reading by eye. 
Using the app replaces the uncertainty from visual RDT interpretation with a 
smaller uncertainty of the image classifier, thereby increasing confidence of 
clinicians and laboratory staff when using RDTs, and creating opportunities for 
patient self-testing.

Population screening played a substantial role in safely reopening the economy 
and avoiding new outbreaks of COVID-19. PCR-based pooled screening makes it 
possible to test the population with limited resources by pooling multiple 
individual samples. Our study compared different population-wide screening 
methods as transmission-mitigating interventions, including pooled PCR, 
individual PCR, and antigen screening. Incorporating testing-isolation process 
and individual-level viral load trajectories into an epidemic model, we further 
studied the impacts of testing-isolation on test sensitivities. Results show 
that the testing-isolation process could maintain a stable test sensitivity 
during the outbreak by removing most infected individuals, especially during the 
epidemic decline. Moreover, we compared the efficiency, accuracy, and cost of 
different screening methods during the pandemic. Our results show that PCR-based 
pooled screening is cost-effective in reversing the pandemic at low prevalence. 
When the prevalence is high, PCR-based pooled screening may not stop the 
outbreak. In contrast, antigen screening with sufficient frequency could reverse 
the epidemic, despite the high cost and the large numbers of false positives in 
the screening process.

One year into the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, diagnostic 
strategies, although central for contact tracing and other preventive measures, 
are still limited. To meet the global demand, lower cost and faster antigen 
tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection 
are a convenient alternative to the gold standard reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. We tested 
laboratory-based RT-PCR RNA detection and two rapid antigen detection (RAD) 
tests, based on the immunochromatography test for nucleocapsid protein of 
SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Ag ECO Test, ECO Diagnóstica, and Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid 
Test Abbott). Paired collection and testing were done in a small prospective 
open study in three clinical services in São Paulo, constituted of mostly 
symptomatic volunteers at collection (97%, 109/112) for a median of 4 days 
(interquartile range: 3-6), ranging from 1 to 30. Among the 108 paired 
RT-PCR/RAD tests, results were concordant in 96.4% (101/108). The test's 
performance was comparable, with an overall sensitivity of 87% and a specificity 
of 96%. These observations add to other data that suggest that antigen tests may 
provide reasonable sensitivity and specificity and deserve a role to improve 
testing strategies, especially in resource-limited settings.

Across the globe, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing distress with 
governments doing everything in their power to contain the spread of the novel 
coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) to prevent morbidity and mortality. Actions are being 
implemented to keep health care systems from being overstretched and to curb the 
outbreak. Any policy responses aimed at slowing down the spread of the virus and 
mitigating its immediate effects on health care systems require a firm basis of 
information about the absolute number of currently infected people, growth 
rates, and locations/hotspots of infections. The only way to obtain this base of 
information is by conducting numerous tests in a targeted way. Currently, in 
Ghana, there is a centralized testing approach, that takes 4-5 days for samples 
to be shipped and tested at central reference laboratories with results 
communicated to the district, regional and national stakeholders. This delay in 
diagnosis increases the risk of ongoing transmission in communities and 
vulnerable institutions. We have validated, evaluated and deployed an innovative 
diagnostic tool on a mobile laboratory platform to accelerate the COVID-19 
testing. A preliminary result of 74 samples from COVID-19 suspected cases has a 
positivity rate of 12% with a turn-around time of fewer than 3 hours from sample 
taking to reporting of results, significantly reducing the waiting time from 
days to hours, enabling expedient response by the health system for contact 
tracing to reduce transmission and additionally improving case management.
FUNDING: Test kits were provided by AngloGold Ashanti Obuasi Mine (AngloGold 
Ashanti Health Foundation). The American Leprosy Mission donated the PCR 
machine, and the mobile laboratory van was funded by the Embassy of the Kingdom 
of the Netherlands (EKN). AAS, YAA was supported by (PANDORA-ID-NET

In December 2019, when the whole world is waiting for Christmas and New Year, 
the physicians of Wuhan, China, are astounded by clusters of patients suffering 
from pneumonia from unknown causes. The pathogen isolated from the respiratory 
epithelium of the patients is similar to previously known coronaviruses with 
some distinct features. The disease was initially called nCoV-2019 or 
SARS-nCoV-2 and later termed as COVID-19 by WHO. The infection is rapidly 
propagating from the day of emergence, spread throughout the globe and now 
became a pandemic which challenged the competencies of developed nations in 
terms of health care management. As per WHO report, 216 countries are affected 
with SARS-CoV-19 by August 5, 2020 with 18, 142, 718 confirmed cases and 691,013 
deaths reports. Such huge mortality and morbidity rates are truly threatening 
and calls for some aggressive and effective measures to slow down the disease 
transmission. The scientists are constantly engaged in finding a potential 
solution to diagnose and treat the pandemic. Various FDA approved drugs with the 
previous history of antiviral potency are repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. 
Different drugs and vaccines are under clinical trials and some rapid and 
effective diagnostic tools are also under development. In this review, we have 
highlighted the current epidemiology through infographics, disease transmission 
and progression, clinical features and diagnosis and possible therapeutic 
approaches for COVID-19. The article mainly focused on the development and 
possible application of various FDA approved drugs, including chloroquine, 
remdesivir, favipiravir, nefamostate mesylate, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, 
ribavirin etc., vaccines under development and various registered clinical 
trials exploring different therapeutic measures for the treatment of COVID-19.

INTRODUCTION: We aim to describe the performance of combined IgM and IgG 
point-of-care antibody test (POC-Ab) (Wondfo®) compared to real-time reverse 
transcriptase (rRT-PCR) (Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay) in detecting coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19).
METHODOLOGY: We compared POC-Ab with rRT-PCR results among patients in a 
tertiary hospital from January to March 2020 in Bandung, Indonesia. We selected 
presumptive COVID-19 patients with positive rRT-PCR consecutively and 20 
patients with negative rRT-PCR results were selected randomly from the same 
group of patients as controls. We described the sensitivity, specificity, 
positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) with 
corresponding 95% confidence interval using serum and capillary blood samples. 
We also tested POC-Ab using non-COVID-19 (confirmed dengue and typhoid) 
patients' sera.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with positive rRT-PCR result and 20 negative 
controls were included (68.1% males, mean age 46 (SD: 15.4)). Using the serum, 
the sensitivity of the POC-Ab was 63.0% (42.4-80.6), specificity was 95.0% 
(75.1-99.9), PPV was 94.4% (72.7-99.8), NPV was 65.5% (45.7-82.1). A subset of 
20 patients was tested using a capillary blood sample. The accuracy of the 
capillary blood sample is lower compared to serum (50.0% vs. 78.7%). None of the 
non-COVID-19 sera tested were reactive.
CONCLUSIONS: POC-Ab for COVID-19 has a high specificity with no false-positive 
result in non-COVID-19 sera. Therefore, it can be used to guide diagnostic among 
symptomatic patients in resource limited settings. Given its low sensitivity, 
patients with high suspicion of COVID-19 but non-reactive result should be 
prioritized for rRT-PCR testing.

AIMS: Providing a ready-to-use reverse transcriptase qPCR (RT-qPCR) method fully 
validated to detect the SARS-CoV-2 with a higher exclusivity than this shown by 
early published RT-qPCR designs.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The specificity of the GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test by 
analysis of sequence alignments was approached and compared with other RT-qPCR 
designs. The GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test was validated following criteria of 
UNE/EN ISO 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189:2012. Diagnostic validation was achieved 
by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 
(Madrid, Spain), the Public Health England (Colindale, London, UK), and received 
the label CE-IVD. The GPS design showed the highest exclusivity and passed all 
parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference 
laboratories 100% correlated with these obtained by using reference methods and 
showed 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: The CE-IVD GPS™ CoVID-19 dtec-RT-qPCR test, available worldwide 
with full analytical and diagnostic validation, is the more exclusive for 
SARS-CoV-2 by far.
SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Considering the CoVID-19 pandemic status, 
the exclusivity of RT-qPCR tests is crucial to avoid false positives due to 
related coronaviruses. This work provides of a highly specific and validated 
RT-qPCR method for detection of SARS-CoV-2, which represents a case of efficient 
transfer of technology successfully used since the pandemic was declared.

We describe an extractionless real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) 
protocol for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection using heat as an accurate 
cost-effective high-capacity solution to COVID-19 testing. We present the effect 
of temperature, transport media, rRT-PCR mastermixes and gene assays on 
SARS-CoV-2 gene amplification and limits of detection. Utilizing our heated 
methodology, our limits of detection were 12.5 and 1 genome copy/reaction for 
singleplex E- and N1-gene assays, respectively, and 1 genome copy/reaction by 
utilizing an E/N1 or Orf1ab/N1 multiplex assay combination. Using this approach, 
we detected up to 98% of COVID-19 positive patient samples analyzed in our 
various cohorts including a significant percentage of weak positives. 
Importantly, this extractionless approach will allow for >2-fold increase in 
testing capacity with existing instruments, circumvent the additional need for 
expensive extraction devices, provide the sensitivity needed for COVID-19 
detection and significantly reduce the turn-around time of reporting COVID-19 
test results.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by coronavirus has spread worldwide 
and has become the deadliest pandemic of the 21st century. Such rapid spread is 
predominantly attributed to the poor diagnosis and its asymptomatic 
transmission. In the absence of treatment regime, timely diagnosis is the best 
available remedy that can restrict its spread. An early diagnosis of COVID-19 is 
critical for determining the line of treatment and preventing long term 
complications in the infected subject. Unfortunately, available rapid antigen 
and antibody kits are known to be erroneous whereas reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction based tests are expensive, viral load dependent and at 
times inconclusive. In current scenario, the false-negative results imposed a 
major risk to the individual patient care and also to the efforts for containing 
the spread at the population level, where as false positives are traumatic for 
families and can lead to improper treatment resulting in severe complications. 
In this article, the limitations of available diagnostic procedures have been 
elaborated and plausible combination approach has been advised.

Infection caused by the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has become a serious 
worldwide public health problem, and one of the most important strategies for 
its control is mass testing. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has 
emerged as an important alternative to simplify the diagnostics of infectious 
diseases. In addition, an advantage of LAMP is that it allows for easy reading 
of the final result through visual detection. However, this step must be 
performed with caution to avoid contamination and false-positive results. LAMP 
performed on microfluidic platforms can minimize false-positive results, in 
addition to having potential for point-of-care applications. Here, we describe a 
polystyrene-toner (PS-T) centrifugal microfluidic device manually controlled by 
a fidget spinner for molecular diagnosis of COVID-19 by RT-LAMP, with integrated 
and automated colorimetric detection. The amplification was carried out in a 
microchamber with 5 μL capacity, and the reaction was thermally controlled with 
a thermoblock at 72 °C for 10 min. At the end of the incubation time, the 
detection of amplified RT-LAMP fragments was performed directly on the chip by 
automated visual detection. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to 
detect COVID-19 in reactions initiated with approximately 10-3 copies of 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Clinical samples were tested using our RT-LAMP protocol as well 
as by conventional RT-qPCR, demonstrating comparable performance to the CDC 
SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR assay. The methodology described in this study represents a 
simple, rapid, and accurate method for rapid molecular diagnostics of COVID-19 
in a disposable microdevice, ideal for point-of-care testing (POCT) systems.

The current pandemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) caused by 
SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) has raised 
significant public health concern. Rapid, affordable, and accurate diagnostics 
of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for early treatment and control of the disease 
spread. In the past few years, CRISPR technology has shown great potential for 
highly sensitive and specific molecular diagnostics. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 
pandemic, there is an increasing interest in implementing CRISPR-based 
diagnostic principles to develop fast and precise methods for detecting 
SARS-CoV-2. In this work, we reviewed and summarized these CRISPR-based 
diagnostic systems as well as their characteristics and challenges. We also 
provided future perspectives of CRISPR-based sensing towards point-of-care 
molecular diagnosis applications.

BACKGROUND: Studies of outpatients with mild or moderate COVID-19 are uncommon. 
We studied: 1) association of symptoms with reverse transcriptase polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test results; and 2) association of initial RT-PCR cycle 
threshold (Ct) in relation to duration of RT-PCR positivity in outpatients with 
mild or moderate COVID-19.
METHODS: This was a cohort study of outpatients with confirmed COVID-19 and at 
least one symptom. Participants had repeat nasopharyngeal swabs and symptom 
checklists every 3-5 days until two consecutive RT-PCR tests were negative. 
RT-PCR tests were used to assess viral load. Antibody tests for COVID-19 were 
performed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 weeks after symptom onset.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (nine females) were enrolled, ranging in age from 
19-58 (median age 28 years). All patients reported at least one symptom, with a 
median of six symptoms per patient. Symptoms persisted for 6-67 days (median 
duration 18 days). In all 25 patients, blood samples collected a median of 13 
days after symptom onset were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 15 (60%). 
After a median of 28 days following symptom onset, 23/23 patients with available 
samples tested positive for antibodies. The longest duration of positive RT-PCR 
test was 49 days from first positive PCR test (Mean = 27.4, SD = 12.5, Median = 
24). Initial Ct was significantly associated with longer duration (β = -1.3, SE 
= 0.3, p<0.01 per 1 cycle higher) of RT-PCR positivity.
CONCLUSIONS: In mildly or moderately ill COVID-19 outpatients, RT-PCT tests 
remained positive for as long as 49 days and test positivity and symptom 
duration correlated with initial viral load.

INTRODUCTION: Patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
require significant healthcare resources. While published research has shown 
clinical characteristics associated with severe illness from COVID-19, there is 
limited data focused on the emergency department (ED) discharge population.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all ED-discharged patients 
from Wake Forest Baptist Health and Wake Forest Baptist Health Davie Medical 
Center between April 25-August 9, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute 
respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from a nasopharyngeal swab using 
real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests. We 
compared the clinical characteristics of patients who were discharged and had 
return visits within 30 days to those patients who did not return to the ED 
within 30 days.
RESULTS: Our study included 235 adult patients who had an ED-performed 
SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR positive test and were subsequently discharged on their first 
ED visit. Of these patients, 57 (24.3%) had return visits to the ED within 30 
days for symptoms related to COVID-19. Of these 57 patients, on return ED visits 
27 were admitted to the hospital and 30 were not admitted. Of the 235 adult 
patients who were discharged, 11.5% (27) eventually required admission for 
COVID-19-related symptoms. With 24.3% patients having a return ED visit after a 
positive SARS-CoV-2 test and 11.5% requiring eventual admission, it is important 
to understand clinical characteristics associated with return ED visits. We 
performed multivariate logistic regression analysis of the clinical 
characteristics with independent association resulting in a return ED visit, 
which demonstrated the following: diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 2.990, 95% 
confidence interval [CI, 1.21-7.40, P = 0.0179); transaminitis (OR 8.973, 95% 
CI, 2.65-30.33, P = 0.004); increased pulse at triage (OR 1.04, 95% CI, 
1.02-1.07, P = 0.0002); and myalgia (OR 4.43, 95% CI, 2.03-9.66, P = 0.0002).
CONCLUSION: As EDs across the country continue to treat COVID-19 patients, it is 
important to understand the clinical factors associated with ED return visits 
related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified key clinical characteristics 
associated with return ED visits for patients initially diagnosed with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection: diabetes mellitus; increased pulse at triage; 
transaminitis; and complaint of myalgias.

This study evaluates the performance of the PanBio COVID-19 antigen (Ag) test as 
part of a hospital infection control policy. Hospital staff was encouraged to 
get tested for COVID-19 when presenting with SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms. In a 
period of approximately 5 months, a steady decline in the performance of the Ag 
test was noted, epidemiologically coinciding with the rise of the SARS-CoV-2 
B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant of concern (VOC) in the Netherlands. This led to the 
hypothesis that the diagnostic performance of the PanBio COVID-19 Ag test was 
influenced by the infecting viral variant. The results show a significantly 
lower sensitivity of the PanBio COVID-19 Ag test in persons infected with the 
B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that in persons 
infected with non-B.1.1.7 variants, also after adjustment for viral load. 
IMPORTANCE Antigen tests for COVID-19 are widely used for rapid identification 
of COVID-19 cases, for example, for access to schools, festivals, and travel. 
There are several FDA- and CE-cleared tests on the market. Their performance has 
been evaluated mainly on the basis of infections by the classical variant of the 
causing virus, SARS-CoV-2. This paper provides evidence that the performance of 
one of the most widely used antigen tests detects significantly fewer cases of 
COVID-19 by the alpha variant than by the classical variants of SARS-CoV-2. This 
means that the role of antigen tests needs to be reevaluated in regions where 
other variants of SARS-CoV-2 predominate.

The COVID-19 pandemic raises the need for diverse diagnostic approaches to 
rapidly detect different stages of viral infection. The flexible and 
quantitative nature of single-molecule imaging technology renders it optimal for 
development of new diagnostic tools. Here we present a proof-of-concept for a 
single-molecule based, enzyme-free assay for detection of SARS-CoV-2. The 
unified platform we developed allows direct detection of the viral genetic 
material from patients' samples, as well as their immune response consisting of 
IgG and IgM antibodies. Thus, it establishes a platform for diagnostics of 
COVID-19, which could also be adjusted to diagnose additional pathogens.

A Convalescent of COVID-19 with RT-PCR Test Continues Positive in Stool.

Yang Z, Yu M, Li G, Dai X, Liu G, Xie J, Li G, Jie Y.

BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected more than 100 countries 
worldwide and the discharge criteria of patients with COVID-19 vary across 
different countries. In China, patients with two negative respiratory viral RNA 
tests taken at least one day apart can be discharged with no further quarantine 
required. Currently, PCR testing of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in fecal sample is not routinely performed.
METHODS: We present a patient with COVID-19, whose respiratory swabs became 
negative but fecal sample remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
RESULTS: Stool sample collected on 27th of February was still positive for 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 24 days after the first negative respiratory swab.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the experience from the 2003 SARS epidemic, we recommend

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Benevolent and hostile ageism are subtypes of ageism 
that characterize older adults as incompetent. With benevolent ageism, older 
adults are also viewed as warm. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic 
has strained resources and prompted debates about priority for older adults 
versus other groups.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: College students completed an online survey of how 
much priority should be given to older adults in 3 relevant health care-related 
scenarios and 3 relevant employment scenarios.
RESULTS: Benevolent ageism significantly predicted higher priority for older 
adults to receive health care (triage, COVID-19 vaccine, and COVID-19 testing) 
and employment resources (retention of job and working from home) while greater 
endorsement of hostile ageism significantly predicted lower priority ratings.
DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings replicate and extend past work. As 
the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on health care and employment 
resources, this study sheds light on one factor-benevolent and hostile 
ageism-that contributes to a greater understanding of prioritization views 
toward a vulnerable segment of the population.

Results of three rapid immunochromatographic tests (ICTs) were compared with 
those obtained with two automated immunoassays for evaluation of their 
usefulness. One hundred fifty-nine patients and 67 healthy volunteers were 
included. Different assays demonstrate 41-45% of diagnostic sensitivities and 
91-98% of specificities, with substantial agreement (89.3-91.2%), but a high 
percentage of weak positive results (13-22%) was observed with ICTs. ICTs 
performances were comparable to those of automated immunoassays. ICTs could have 
a role as screening approach due to their easy usability. Subjective 
interpretation, significant rate of uncertain results, uncertainty on viral 
antigens source are undoubtedly drawbacks.

We report the earliest known cluster of SARS-CoV-2 infection so far reported, 
which occurred in New Zealand in late February 2020. The cluster includes one 
confirmed and five probable cases. The cluster was identified while 
investigating a weak positive nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) test that was returned by a male in his 60s in September 2020. 
The PCR result, combined with a clear clinical and epidemiological history of a 
COVID-19 like illness in late February 2020, prompted serological testing. 
SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected and supported historical infection. 
Serology was also reactive for five close contacts who had also experienced a 
COVID-19 like illness in February 2020. Combined case histories and 
investigations suggest that this local cluster was import related, with the 
index case identified as a family member visiting from Italy in February. Case 
investigation also suggests this cluster was active in New Zealand prior to any 
previously documented local cases, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 was present and 
local transmission was occurring earlier than initially suspected. A weak 
positive PCR result, six months after acute infection, supports international 
evidence that SARS-CoV-2 genetic material can be detected for several months 
after initial COVID-19 infection, and that this is not necessarily indicative of 
infectivity.

Automated assays for detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnostics have 
recently come available. We compared the performance of the Elecsys® 
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 and LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG tests. The seroconversion 
panel comprised of 120 samples from 13 hospitalized COVID-19 patients. For the 
sensitivity and specificity testing, samples from COVID-19 outpatients >15 days 
after positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) result (n = 35) and serum 
control samples collected before the COVID-19 era (n = 161) were included in the 
material. Samples for the detection of possible cross-reactions were also 
tested. Based on our results, the SARS-CoV-2 antibodies can be quite reliably 
detected 2 weeks after NAAT positivity and 3 weeks after the symptom onset with 
both tests. However, since some COVID-19 patients were positive only with 
Elecsys®, the antibodies should be screened against N-antigen (Elecsys®) and 
reactive samples confirmed with S antigen (LIAISON®), but both results should be 
reported. In some COVID-19 patients, the serology can remain negative.

Multiple polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard 
diagnostic investigation for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, false 
negative multiple polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results can be 
diagnostically challenging. We report three patients with history of fever and 
different clinical signs. During the height of the pandemic in Italy (March to 
May 2020), these patients underwent chest computed tomography (CT) scans that 
showed lung alterations typical of COVID-19 with multiple negative RT-PCR tests 
and positive serology for SARS-CoV-2. Two of the three patients showed residual 
pneumonia on CT after the onset of the first clinical signs. One patient 
presented with diarrhoea without respiratory symptoms. These cases suggest that 
in the COVID-19 pandemic period, to provide an earlier specific treatment in 
patients with positive serology, a chest CT scan can be useful in those 
presenting with a fever or a history of fever associated with persistent mild 
respiratory symptoms or with abdominal complaints despite repeated negative 
RT-PCR results.

Not all persons recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) infection develop SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We show that 
nonseroconversion is associated with younger age and higher reverse 
transcription PCR cycle threshold values and identify SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in 
the nasopharynx as a major correlate of the systemic antibody response.

Combating the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic demands 
accurate, rapid, and point-of-care testing with fast results to triage cases for 
isolation and treatment. The current testing relies on reverse transcriptase PCR 
(RT-PCR), which is routinely performed in well-equipped laboratories by trained 
professionals at specific locations. However, during busy periods, high numbers 
of samples queued for testing can delay the test results, impacting efforts to 
reduce the infection risk. Besides, the absence of well-established laboratories 
at remote sites and low-resourced environments can contribute to a silent spread 
of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These reasons 
compel the need to accommodate point-of-care testing for COVID-19 that meets the 
ASSURED criteria (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and 
robust, equipment-free, and deliverable). This study assessed the agreement and 
accuracy of the portable Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system against the gold standard 
tests. Nasopharyngeal and nasal swabs were used. Of the 192 samples tested using 
the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system, the results from 189 samples (98.4%) were in 
agreement with the reference standard-of-care RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. The 
portable system generated simultaneous results for nine samples in 80 min with 
high positive and negative percent agreements of 99.0% and 97.8%, respectively. 
We performed separate testing in a sealed glove box, offering complete biosafety 
containment. Thus, the Biomeme SARS-CoV-2 system can help decentralize COVID-19 
testing and offer rapid test results for patients in remote and low-resourced 
settings.

OBJECTIVES: The inconclusive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result causes confusion and delay 
for infection prevention precautions and patient management. We aimed to develop 
a quantitative algorithm to assess and interpret these inconclusive results.
METHODS: We created a score-based algorithm by combining laboratory, clinical, 
and epidemiologic data to evaluate 69 cases with inconclusive coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) PCR results from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) assay (18 cases) and the TaqPath assay (51 cases).
RESULTS: We determined 5 (28%) of 18 (CDC assay) and 20 (39%) of 51 (TaqPath 
assay) cases to be false positive. Lowering the cycle threshold cutoff from 40 
to 37 in the TaqPath assay resulted in a dramatic reduction of the 
false-positive rate to 14%. We also showed testing of asymptomatic individuals 
is associated with a significantly higher probability of having a false-positive 
result.
CONCLUSIONS: A substantial percentage of inconclusive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results can 
be false positive, especially among asymptomatic patients. The quantitative 
algorithm we created was shown to be effective and could provide a useful tool 
for clinicians and hospital epidemiologists to interpret inconclusive COVID-19 
PCR results and provide clinical guidance when additional PCR or antibody test 
results are available.

Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the chest plays an important role in the 
diagnosis and management of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease 
caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 pneumonia shows typical CT 
Scan features which can aid diagnoses and therefore help in the early detection 
and isolation of infected patients. CT scanners are readily available in many 
parts of Ghana. It is able to show findings typical for COVID-19 infection of 
the chest, even in instances where Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain 
Reaction (RTPCR) misses the diagnosis. Little is known about the diagnostic 
potential of chest CT scan and COVID-19 among physicians even though CT scan 
offers a high diagnostic accuracy.

SARS-CoV-2 serological tests are used to assess the infection seroprevalence 
within a population. This study aims at assessing potential biases in estimating 
infection prevalence amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) when different diagnostic 
criteria are considered. A multi-site cross-sectional study was carried out in 
April-September 2020 amongst 1.367 Italian HCWs. SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 
assessed using three diagnostic criteria: RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swab, 
point-of-care fingerprick serological test (POCT) result and COVID-19 clinical 
pathognomonic presentation. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the 
probability of POCT-positive result in relation to the time since infection 
(RT-PCR positivity). Among 1.367 HCWs, 69.2% were working in COVID-19 units. 
Statistically significant differences in age, role and gender were observed 
between COVID-19/non-COVID-19 units. Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection varied 
according to the criterion considered: 6.7% for POCT, 8.1% for RT-PCR, 10.0% for 
either POCT or RT-PCR, 9.6% for infection pathognomonic clinical presentation 
and 17.6% when at least one of the previous criteria was present. The 
probability of POCT-positive result decreased by 1.1% every 10 days from the 
infection. This study highlights potential biases in estimating SARS-CoV-2 
point-prevalence data according to the criteria used. Although informative on 
infection susceptibility and herd immunity level, POCT serological tests are not 
the best predictors of previous COVID-19 infections for public health monitoring 
programmes.

Serology or antibody tests for COVID-19 are designed to detect antibodies 
(mainly Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) produced in response 
to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) infection. In 
this study, 30 lateral flow immunoassays were tested using serum or plasma from 
patients with confirmed SARS CoV-2 infection. Negative serological controls were 
accessed from a well-characterised bank of sera which were stored prior to 
February 2020. Operational characteristics and ease of use of the assays are 
reported. 4/30 (13%) of kits (Zheihang Orient Gene COVID-19 IgG/IgM, Genrui 
Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) IgG/IgM, Biosynex COVID-19 BSS IgG/IgM, Boson 
Biotech 2019-nCoV IgG/IgM) were recommended for SAHPRA approval based on kit 
sensitivity. Of these, only the Orientgene was recommended by SAHPRA in August 
2020 for use within the approved national testing algorithm while the remaining 
three received limited authorization for evaluation. All kits evaluated work on 
the same basic principle of immunochromatography with minor differences noted in 
the shape and colour of cartridges, the amount of specimen volume required and 
the test duration. Performance of the lateral flow tests were similar to 
sensitivities and specificities reported in other studies. The cassettes of the 
majority of kits evaluated (90%) detected both IgG and IgM. Only 23% of kits 
evaluated contained all consumables required for point-of-care testing. The 
study highlights the need for thorough investigation of kits prior to

BACKGROUND: Rapid, reliable, and widespread testing is required to curtail the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Current gold-standard nucleic acid tests are hampered 
by supply shortages in critical reagents including nasal swabs, RNA extraction 
kits, personal protective equipment, instrumentation, and labor.
METHODS: To overcome these challenges, we developed a rapid colorimetric assay 
using reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) 
optimized on human saliva samples without an RNA purification step. We describe 
the optimization of saliva pretreatment protocols to enable analytically 
sensitive viral detection by RT-LAMP. We optimized the RT-LAMP reaction 
conditions and implemented high-throughput unbiased methods for assay 
interpretation. We tested whether saliva pretreatment could also enable viral 
detection by conventional reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction (RT-qPCR). Finally, we validated these assays on clinical samples.
RESULTS: The optimized saliva pretreatment protocol enabled analytically 
sensitive extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by colorimetric 
RT-LAMP or RT-qPCR. In simulated samples, the optimized RT-LAMP assay had a 
limit of detection of 59 (95% confidence interval: 44-104) particle copies per 
reaction. We highlighted the flexibility of LAMP assay implementation using 3 
readouts: naked-eye colorimetry, spectrophotometry, and real-time fluorescence. 
In a set of 30 clinical saliva samples, colorimetric RT-LAMP and RT-qPCR assays 
performed directly on pretreated saliva samples without RNA extraction had 
accuracies greater than 90%.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and extraction-free detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva by 
colorimetric RT-LAMP is a simple, sensitive, and cost-effective approach with 
broad potential to expand diagnostic testing for the virus causing COVID-19.

Several rapid testing methodologies have been approved for testing of 
symptomatic individuals but have not been validated for asymptomatic screening. 
We evaluated performance of the Abbott PanbioTM COVID-19 rapid antigen assay in 
the asymptomatic setting. We conducted a prospective study in an urban 
assessment center and in the context of long-term care staff screening. A total 
of 3014 individuals submitted paired nasopharyngeal samples, which were tested 
in parallel with the rapid antigen and laboratory-based, RT-PCR assays 
SARS-CoV-2 detection. There was 54.5% concordance in positive results between 
the rapid antigen assay and RT-PCR. All positive rapid antigen assay results 
were confirmed by RT-PCR. The negative predictive value of the rapid antigen 
assay minimally improved on the negative pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 
infection. The Abbott PanbioTM COVID-19 rapid antigen test allowed for faster 
identification of infected individuals but cannot be used to rule-out SARS-CoV-2 
infection.

There is rising concern that patients who recover from COVID-19 may be at risk 
of recurrence. Increased rates of infection and recurrence in healthcare workers 
could cause the healthcare system collapse and a further worsening of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, we reported the clinically symptomatic recurrent 
COVID-19 cases in the two healthcare workers who treated and recovered from 
symptomatic and laboratory confirmed COVID-19. We discuss important questions in 
the COVID-19 pandemic waiting to be answered, such as the protection period of 
the acquired immunity, the severity of recurrence and how long after the first 
infection occurs. We aimed to emphasize that healthcare workers should continue 
to pay maximum attention to the measures without compromising.

BACKGROUND: Serological severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) antibody assays differ in the target antigen specificity, e.g. of 
antibodies directed against the viral spike or the nucleocapsid protein, and in 
the spectrum of detected immunoglobulins. The aim of the study was to evaluate 
the performance of two different routinely used immunoassays in hospitalized and 
outpatient COVID-19 cases.
METHODS: The test characteristics of commercially available spike1 protein-based 
serological assays (Euroimmun, EI-assays), determining IgA or IgG and 
nucleocapsid-based assays (Virotech, VT-assays) determining IgA, IgM or IgG were 
compared in 139 controls and 116 hospitalized and outpatient COVID-19 cases.
RESULTS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients (n = 51; 115 samples) showed 
significantly higher concentrations of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and 
differed from outpatient cases (n = 65) by higher age, higher disease severity 
scores and earlier follow up blood sampling. Sensitivity of the two IgG assays 
was comparable in hospitalized patients tested ≥ 14 days (EI-assay: 88%, CI95% 
67.6-99.9; VT-assay: 96%, CI95% 77.7-99.8). In outpatient COVID-19 cases 
sensitivity was significantly lower in the VT-assay (86.2%, CI95% 74.8-93.1) 
compared with the EI-assay (98.5%, CI95% 90.6-99.9). Assays for IgA and IgM 
demonstrated a lack of specificity or sensitivity.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 serological assays may need to 
be optimized to produce reliable results in outpatient COVID-19 cases who are 
low or even asymptomatic. Assays for IgA and IgM have limited diagnostic 
performance and do not prove an additional value for population-based screening 
approaches.

BACKGROUND: The presence of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) is an indicator of 
protective immunity for most viral infections. A newly developed surrogate viral 
neutralization assay (sVNT) offers the ability to detect total receptor binding 
domain-targeting NAbs in an isotype-independent manner, increasing the test 
sensitivity. Thus, specimens with low IgM/ IgG antibody levels showed strong 
neutralization activity in sVNT.
METHODS: This study aimed to measure the %inhibition of NAbs measured by sVNT in 
PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients. The sensitivity of sVNT for the diagnosis of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and its kinetics were determined.
RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients with PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were 
included in this study. Majority of the patients were 21-40 years old (67%) and 
63% had mild symptoms. The sensitivity of sVNT for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 
infection was 99% (95% confidence interval (CI) 94.4-100%) and the specificity 
was 100% (95% CI 98.3-100%). The negative predictive value of sVNT from the 
samples collected before and after 7 days of symptom onset was 99.5% (95% CI 
97.4-100%) and 100% (95% CI 93.8-100%), respectively. The level of inhibition at 
days 8-14 were significantly higher than days 0-7 (p<0.001). The median 
%inhibition values by severity of COVID-19 symptoms were 79.9% (interquartile 
range (IQR) 49.7-91.8%); 89.0% (IQR 71.2-92.4%); and 86.6% (IQR 69.5-92.8%), for 
mild, moderate and severe/critical symptoms respectively. The median level of 
sVNT %inhibition of severe was significantly higher than the mild group (p = 
0.05).
CONCLUSION: The sVNT is a practical and robust serological test for SARS-CoV-2 
infection and does not require specialized biosafety containment. It can be used 
clinically to aid diagnosis in both early and late infection especially in cases 
when the real-time RT-PCR results in weakly negative or weakly positive, and to 
determine the protective immune response from SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients.

Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is 
considered the "gold standard" for the direct diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 
infections. However, routine diagnosis by RT-qPCR is a limitation for many 
laboratories, mainly due to the infrastructure and/or disproportionate 
relationship between demand and supply of inputs. In this context, and to 
increase the diagnostic coverage of SARS-CoV-2 infections, we describe an 
alternative, sensitive and specific one-step end-point RT-PCR for the detection 
of the SARS-CoV-2 E gene. The performance of the RT-PCR was evaluated in 43 
clinical samples, of which 10 and 33 were previously identified as negative and 
positive, respectively, by RT-qPCR. Among the positive samples, 15 and 18 were 
from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, respectively. Here, 32/33 of the 
positive samples in the RT-qPCR, including from asymptomatic individuals, were 
found positive in the RT-PCR (Ct 15.94-34.92). The analytical sensitivity of the 
assay was about 7.15-9 copies of vRNA/μL, and nonspecific amplifications were 
not observed in SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. Importantly, the RT-PCR reactions 
were performed in a 10 μL final volume. Finally, considering specificity, 
analytical sensitivity and cost reduction, we believe that the RT-PCR platform 
described here may be a viable option for the diagnostic of SARS-CoV-2 
infections in laboratories in which RT-qPCR is not available.

Vaccination: A Perspective.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus causes a 
spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic to mild, 
moderate, or severe illness with multi-organ failure and death. Using a new 
machine learning algorithm developed by us, we have reported a significantly 
higher number of predicted COVID-19 cases than the documented counts across the 
world. The sole reliance on confirmed symptomatic cases overlooking the 
symptomless COVID-19 infections and the dynamics of waning immunity may not 
provide 'true' spectrum of infection proportion, a key element for an effective 
planning and implementation of protection and prevention strategies. We and 
others have previously shown that strategic orthogonal testing and leveraging 
systematic data-driven modeling approach to account for asymptomatics and waning 
cases may situationally have a compelling role in informing efficient 
vaccination strategies beyond prevalence reporting. However, currently Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not recommend serological testing 
either before or after vaccination to assess immune status. Given the 27% 
occurrence of breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated (FV) group with many 
being asymptomatics and still a larger fraction of the general mass remaining 
unvaccinated, the relaxed mask mandate and distancing by CDC can drive 
resurgence. Thus, we believe it is a key time to focus on asymptomatics (no 
symptoms) and oligosymptomatics (so mild that the symptoms remain unrecognized) 
as they can be silent reservoirs to propagate the infection. This perspective 
thus highlights the need for proactive efforts to reevaluate the current 
variables/strategies in accounting for symptomless and waning fractions.

Community-Informed Mobile COVID-19 Testing Model to Addressing Health 
Inequities.

CONTEXT: The New York City (NYC) Test & Trace Corps (Test & Trace), under New 
York City Health + Hospitals (NYC H+H), set out to provide universal access to 
COVID-19 testing. Test & Trace partnered with numerous organizations to direct 
mobile COVID-19 testing from concept through implementation to reduce 
COVID-19-related health inequities.
PROGRAM: Test & Trace employs a community-informed mobile COVID-19 testing model 
to deliver testing to the hardest-hit, underserved communities. Community 
partners, uniquely knowledgeable of the residents they serve, are engaged as 
decision makers and operational partners in mobile COVID-19 testing delivery.
IMPLEMENTATION: Through several mobile testing methods, community partners 
choose testing locations and tailor outreach to their community. Test & Trace 
assumes logistical responsibility for mobile testing but defers critical 
programmatic decisions and community engagement to partners. Integral to the 
success of this program is responsive, bidirectional communication.
EVALUATION: During the reporting period of December 1, 2020, to April 30, 2021, 
Test & Trace's community-informed mobile COVID-19 testing model provided testing 
to 150351 unique patients and processed 274083 tests in total. The available 
outcomes data and qualitative feedback provided by community partners illustrate 
that this intervention, combined with robust governmental investment, 
successfully ensured that NYC-identified, low-resource neighborhoods had greater 
access to COVID-19 testing.
DISCUSSION: Making community partners decision makers reduced inequities in 
access to testing for communities of color. In addition, the model has served as 
the framework for Test & Trace's community-informed mobile COVID-19 vaccination 
program, operated in concert with NYC's Vaccine Command Center, and is a 
foundation for addressing health inequities at scale, including during public 
health crises.

Serological tests play an important role in the fight against Coronavirus 
Disease 2019 (COVID-19), including monitoring the dynamic immune response after 
vaccination, identifying past infection and determining community infection 
rate. Conventional methods for serological testing, such as enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays and chemiluminescence immunoassays, provide reliable and 
sensitive antibody detection but require sophisticated laboratory infrastructure 
and/or lengthy assay time. Conversely, lateral flow immunoassays are suitable 
for rapid point-of-care tests but have limited sensitivity. Here, we describe 
the development of a rapid and sensitive magnetofluidic immuno-PCR platform that 
can address the current gap in point-of-care serological testing for COVID-19. 
Our magnetofluidic immuno-PCR platform automates a magnetic bead-based, 
single-binding, and one-wash immuno-PCR assay in a palm-sized magnetofluidic 
device and delivers results in ∼30 min. In the device, a programmable magnetic 
arm attracts and transports magnetically-captured antibodies through assay 
reagents pre-loaded in a companion plastic cartridge, and a miniaturized 
thermocycler and a fluorescence detector perform immuno-PCR to detect the 
antibodies. We evaluated our magnetofluidic immuno-PCR with 108 clinical 
serum/plasma samples and achieved 93.8% (45/48) sensitivity and 98.3% (59/60) 
specificity, demonstrating its potential as a rapid and sensitive point-of-care 
serological test for COVID-19.

OBJECTIVE: We documented an older female with Coronavirus(CoV) Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) and concomitant acquired monocular blindness. We examined this 
phenomenon in order to understand COVID-19 better.
METHODS: We observed an older female with COVID-19 and concomitant acquired 
monocular blindness. The following indicators were monitored during the course 
of the disease: ocular examinations, flash visual evoked potential examination, 
a blood test for COVID-19 IgM antibodies, as well as nasopharyngeal swab and 
tear sample tests for COVID-19 nucleic acid.
RESULTS: The patient's visual acuity for the left eye was NLP and the 
intraocular pressure was 51 mmHg. Keratic precipitates similar to mutton-fat 
were spread over the corneal endothelium of the left eye. The funduscopic 
examination of the patient's left eye revealed severe retinal arterial ischemia, 
and the color of the retina was off-white. Compared to the right eye, the flash 
visual evoked potential examination revealed a moderate decrease in P2 wave 
amplitude for the left eye. A blood test was positive for COVID-19 IgM 
antibodies, and a nasopharyngeal swab test taken for COVID-19 nucleic acid was 
positive on May 4, 2020. A sample of the patient's tears was taken, and the 
nucleic acid test for COVID-19 was still positive two weeks later.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study was the first to find that acute viral retinitis could 
occur in patients with COVID-19 and severe blindness could be associated with 
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, physicians should consider the possibility of 
coronavirus infection in patients with an abnormal fundus or suddenly vision 
loss.

Screening, testing and contact tracing plays a pivotal role in control of the 
COVID-19 pandemic. To enable this it is necessary to increase the testing 
capacity. This study compared a SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen test (RAT) and RT-PCR 
in 842 asymptomatic individuals from Tarapacá, Chile. A sensitivity of 69.86%, 
specificity of 99.61%, PPV of 94.44% and NPP of 97.22% with Ct values (Ct > 27) 
that were significantly higher among individuals with false-negative RAT were 
reported. These results support the fact that RAT might have a significant 
impact on the identification of asymptomatic carriers in areas that lack 
suitable laboratories to perform SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR diagnostics, or the 
results take more than 24-48 h, as well as zones with high traffic of 
individuals such as border/customs, airports, interregional bus, train stations 
or in any mass testing campaign requiring rapid results.

Efficient and effective viral detection methodologies are a critical piece in 
the global response to COVID-19, with PCR-based nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal 
swab testing serving as the current gold standard. With over 100 million 
confirmed cases globally, the supply chains supporting these PCR testing efforts 
are under a tremendous amount of stress, driving the need for innovative and 
accurate diagnostic solutions. Herein, the utility of a direct-to-PCR method of 
SARS-CoV-2 detection grounded in mechanical homogenization is examined for 
reducing resources needed for testing while maintaining a comparable sensitivity 
to the current gold standard workflow of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab 
testing. In a head-to-head comparison of 30 patient samples, this initial 
clinical validation study of the proposed homogenization-based workflow 
demonstrated significant agreeability with the current extraction-based method 
utilized while cutting the total resources needed in half.

Serological test is a valuable diagnostic tool for coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19). However, considerable improvements to these tests are needed, 
especially in the detection sensitivity. In this study, six recombinant 
nucleocapsid and spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2) were prepared and evaluated, including three prokaryotic 
expression nucleocapsid proteins (rN, rN1, rN2) and three eukaryotic expression 
spike proteins (rS1, rS-RBD, rS-RBD-mFc). The recombinant proteins with the 
highest ELISA titers (rS1 and rS-RBD-mFc) were selected to develop a 
double-antigen sandwich colloidal gold immunochromatography assay (GICA) to 
detect total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The clinical evaluation results 
showed that the sensitivity and specificity of GICA were 92.09% (419/455) and 
99.44% (706/710), respectively. Moreover, a significant number (65.63%, 21/32) 
of COVID-19 patients with undetectable viral RNA were correctly diagnosed by the 
GICA method. In conclusion, the eukaryotic expression spike proteins (rS1 and 
rS-RBD-mFc) are more suitable than the prokaryotic expression nucleocapsid 
proteins for serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. The proposed GICA for 
detection of total antibodies could be a powerful complement to the current RNA 
tests for COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: The availability of accurate and rapid diagnostic tools for COVID-19 
is essential for tackling the ongoing pandemic. Our study aimed to quantify the 
performance of available antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) in a 
real-world hospital setting.
METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, the diagnostic performance of 7 Ag-RDTs 
was compared with real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction assay in terms of sensitivity, specificity and expected predictive 
values.
RESULTS: A total of 321 matched Ag-RDTreal-time reverse transcription 
quantitative polymerase chain reaction samples were analyzed retrospectively. 
The overall sensitivity and specificity of the Ag-RDTs was 78.7% and 100%, 
respectively. However, a wide range of sensitivity estimates by brand 
(66.0%-93.8%) and cycle threshold (Ct) cut-off values (Ct <25: 96.2%; Ct 30-35: 
31.1%) was observed. The optimal Ct cut-off value that maximized sensitivity was 
29.
CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of Ag-RDTs may be convenient in moderate-to-high 
intensity settings when high volumes of specimens are tested every day. However, 
the diagnostic performance of the commercially available tests may differ 
substantially.

BACKGROUND: Commercial availability of serological tests to evaluate 
immunoglobulins (Ig) targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 
(SARS-CoV-2) has grown exponentially since the start of the coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Thorough validation of these tests is important before 
use as epidemiological tools to infer seroprevalence in specific populations and 
as diagnostic tools to complement molecular approaches (e.g., quantitative 
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction).
METHODS: Commercial serological tests from 11 suppliers were assayed 
side-by-side using 126 samples from SARS-CoV-2-infected inpatients and 36 from 
healthy and HIV-infected individuals.
RESULTS: The majority of the tests assayed have >95% specificity. For the 
sensitivity calculation, samples were stratified by days since symptoms onset; 
sensitivity peaks at 16-21 days for IgM and IgA (maximum 91.2%, Euroimmun) and, 
dependant on the test, at 16-21 or >21 days for IgG (maximum 94.1%, Snibe). Data 
from semiquantitative tests show that patients with a severe clinical 
presentation have lower levels of Ig targeting SARS-CoV-2 at <10 days since 
symptoms onset and higher levels at >21 days, compared to patients with a 
non-severe presentation.
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the heterogeneity of sensitivity and 
generally high specificity of the serological tests and establishes a basis for 
their usefulness to complement diagnostic techniques and population 
seroprevalence studies.

The rapid detection of novel pathogens including SARS-CoV-2 necessitates the 
development of easy-to-use diagnostic tests that can be readily adapted and 
utilized in both clinical laboratories and field settings. Delay in diagnosis 
has facilitated the rapid spread of this novel virus throughout the world 
resulting in global mortality that will surpass 2.5 million people. Development 
of point-of-care diagnostic assays that can be performed in rural or 
decentralized health care centers to expand testing capacity is needed. We 
developed a qualitative test based on recombinase-polymerase-amplification 
coupled with lateral flow reading (RPA-LF) for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2. 
The RPA-LF detected SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 35.4 viral cDNA 
nucleocapsid (N) gene copies/μL. Additionally, the RPA-LF was able to detect 
0.25-2.5 copies/μL of SARS-CoV-2 N gene containing plasmid. We evaluated 37 
nasopharyngeal samples using CDC's N3, N1 and N2 RT-real-time PCR assays for 
SARS-CoV-2 as reference test. We found a 100 % concordance between RPA-LF and 
RT-qPCR reference test as determined by 18/18 positive and 19/19 negative 
samples. All positive samples had Ct values between 19-37 by RT-qPCR. The RPA-LF 
primers and probe did not cross react with other relevant betacoronaviruses such 
as SARS and MERS. This is the first isothermal amplification test paired with 
lateral flow developed for qualitative detection of COVID-19 allowing rapid 
viral detection and with prospective applicability in resource limited and 
decentralized laboratories.

BACKGROUND: School-based COVID-19 contacts in England have been asked to 
self-isolate at home, missing key educational opportunities. We trialled daily 
testing of contacts as an alternative to assess whether this resulted in similar 
control of transmission, while allowing more school attendance.
METHODS: We did an open-label, cluster-randomised, controlled trial in secondary 
schools and further education colleges in England. Schools were randomly 
assigned (1:1) to self-isolation of school-based COVID-19 contacts for 10 days 
(control) or to voluntary daily lateral flow device (LFD) testing for 7 days 
with LFD-negative contacts remaining at school (intervention). Randomisation was 
stratified according to school type and size, presence of a sixth form, presence 
of residential students, and proportion of students eligible for free school 
meals. Group assignment was not masked during procedures or analysis. Coprimary 
outcomes in all students and staff were COVID-19-related school absence and 
symptomatic PCR-confirmed COVID-19, adjusted for community case rates, to 
estimate within-school transmission (non-inferiority margin <50% relative 
increase). Analyses were done on an intention-to-treat basis using quasi-Poisson 
regression, also estimating complier average causal effects (CACE). This trial 
is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN18100261.
FINDINGS: Between March 18 and May 4, 2021, 204 schools were taken through the 
consent process, during which three decided not to participate further. 201 
schools were randomly assigned (control group n=99, intervention group n=102) in 
the 10-week study (April 19-May 10, 2021), which continued until the 
pre-appointed stop date (June 27, 2021). 76 control group schools and 86 
intervention group schools actively participated; additional national data 
allowed most non-participating schools to be included in analysis of coprimary 
outcomes. 2432 (42·4%) of 5763 intervention group contacts participated in daily 
contact testing. There were 657 symptomatic PCR-confirmed infections during 
7 782 537 days-at-risk (59·1 per 100 000 per week) in the control group and 740 
during 8 379 749 days-at-risk (61·8 per 100 000 per week) in the intervention 
group (intention-to-treat adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR] 0·96 [95% CI 
0·75-1·22]; p=0·72; CACE aIRR 0·86 [0·55-1·34]). Among students and staff, there 
were 59 422 (1·62%) COVID-19-related absences during 3 659 017 
person-school-days in the control group and 51 541 (1·34%) during 3 845 208 
person-school-days in the intervention group (intention-to-treat aIRR 0·80 [95% 
CI 0·54-1·19]; p=0·27; CACE aIRR 0·61 [0·30-1·23]).
INTERPRETATION: Daily contact testing of school-based contacts was non-inferior 
to self-isolation for control of COVID-19 transmission, with similar rates of 
symptomatic infections among students and staff with both approaches. Infection 
rates in school-based contacts were low, with very few school contacts testing 
positive. Daily contact testing should be considered for implementation as a 
safe alternative to home isolation following school-based exposures.

The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been challenging human health worldwide. Loop-mediated 
isothermal amplification (LAMP) has been promptly applied to the detection of 
SARS-CoV-2 owing to its high amplification efficacy and less requirement of the 
thermal cycler. However, the vast majority of these LAMP-based assays depend on 
the non-specific detection of LAMP products, which can not discern the 
undesirable amplificons, likely to yield unreliable results. Herein, a 
sequence-specific LAMP assay was reported to detect SARS-CoV-2 using 
proofreading enzyme-mediated probe cleavage (named Proofman), which could 
realize real-time and visual detection without uncapping. This assay, 
introducing a proofreading enzyme and the fluorogenic probe to 
reverse-transcription LAMP (RT-Proofman-LAMP), can specifically detect the 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA with a detection limit of 100 copies. In addition to the 
real-time analysis, the assay is capable of endpoint visualization under a 
transilluminator within 50 min, providing a convenient reporting manner under 
the setting of point-of-care testing (POCT). In combination with different 
fluorophores, the one-pot multiplex assay was successfully achieved to detect 
multiple targets of SARS-CoV-2 and inner control simultaneously. In summary, the 
development of RT-Proofman-LAMP offers a versatile and highly-specific method 
for fast field screening and laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2, making it a 
promising platform in COVID-19 diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA 
quantities, measured by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), have 
been proposed to stratify clinical risk or determine analytical performance 
targets. We investigated reproducibility and how setting diagnostic cutoffs 
altered the clinical sensitivity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) testing.
METHODS: Quantitative SARS-CoV-2 RNA distributions [quantification cycle (Cq) 
and copies/mL] from more than 6000 patients from 3 clinical laboratories in 
United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Republic of Korea were analyzed. Impact of Cq 
cutoffs on clinical sensitivity was assessed. The June/July 2020 INSTAND 
external quality assessment scheme SARS-CoV-2 materials were used to estimate 
laboratory reported copies/mL and to estimate the variation in copies/mL for a 
given Cq.
RESULTS: When the WHO-suggested Cq cutoff of 25 was applied, the clinical 
sensitivity dropped to about 16%. Clinical sensitivity also dropped to about 27% 
when a simulated limit of detection of 106 copies/mL was applied. The 
interlaboratory variation for a given Cq value was >1000 fold in copies/mL (99% 
CI).
CONCLUSION: While RT-qPCR has been instrumental in the response to COVID-19, we 
recommend Cq (cycle threshold or crossing point) values not be used to set 
clinical cutoffs or diagnostic performance targets due to poor interlaboratory 
reproducibility; calibrated copy-based units (used elsewhere in virology) offer 
more reproducible alternatives. We also report a phenomenon where diagnostic 
performance may change relative to the effective reproduction number. Our 
findings indicate that the disparities between patient populations across time 
are an important consideration when evaluating or deploying diagnostic tests. 
This is especially relevant to the emergency situation of an evolving pandemic.

There is currently a high level of demand for rapid COVID-19 tests, that can 
detect the onset of the disease at point of care settings. We have developed an 
ultra-portable, self-contained, point-of-care nucleic acid amplification test 
for diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection, based on the principle of loop 
mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). The LAMP assay is 100% sensitive and 
specific to detect a minimum of 300 RNA copies/reaction of SARS-CoV-2. All of 
the required sample transportation, lysing and amplification steps are performed 
in a standalone disposable cartridge, which is controlled by a battery operated, 
pocket size (6x9x4cm3) unit. The test is easy to operate and does not require 
skilled personnel. The total time from sample to answer is approximately 35 min; 
a colorimetric readout indicates positive or negative results. This portable 
diagnostic platform has significant potential for rapid and effective testing in 
community settings. This will accelerate clinical decision making, in terms of 
effective triage and timely therapeutic and infection control interventions.

A comprehensive clinical and microbiological assessments of COVID-19 in 
front-line healthcare workers (HCWs) is needed. Between April 10th and May 28th, 
2020, 319 HCWs with acute illness were reviewed. In addition to SARS-CoV-2 
RT-PCR screening, a multiplex molecular panel was used for testing other 
respiratory pathogens. For SARS-CoV-2 positive HCWs, the normalized viral load, 
viral culture, and virus neutralization assays were performed weekly. For 
SARS-CoV-2 negative HCWs, SARS-CoV-2 serological testing was performed one month 
after inclusion. Among the 319 HCWs included, 67 (21.0%) were tested positive 
for SARS-CoV-2; 65/67 (97.0%) developed mild form of COVID-19. Other respiratory 
pathogens were found in 6/66 (9.1%) SARS-CoV-2 positive and 47/241 (19.5%) 
SARS-Cov-2 negative HCWs (p = 0.07). The proportion of HCWs with a viral 
load > 5.0 log10 cp/mL (Ct value < 25) was less than 15% at 8 days after symptom 
onset; 12% of HCWs were positive after 40 days (Ct > 37). More than 90% of 
cultivable virus had a viral load > 4.5 log10 cp/mL (Ct < 26) and were collected 
within 10 days after symptom onset. Among negative HCWs, 6/190 (3.2%) 
seroconverted. Our data suggest that the determination of viral load can be used 
for appreciating the infectiousness of infected HCWs. These data could be 
helpful for facilitating their return to work.

BACKGROUND: Numerous rapid antigen detection (RAD) kits for diagnosing COVID-19 
patients are available in the market recently.
OBJECTIVE: To compare analytical sensitivity and clinical sensitivity for the 
three commercially available RAD kits.
STUDY DESIGN: Analytical sensitivity for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus was 
determined by limit of detection (LOD) using RT-PCR as a reference method. 
Clinical sensitivity was evaluated by using respiratory specimens collected from 
confirmed COVID-19 patients.
RESULTS: The LOD results showed that the three RAD kits varied from 102-105 fold 
less sensitive than RT-PCR. Clinical sensitivity of RAD kits ranged from 22.9 
%-71.4 % for detecting specimens from COVID-19 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Although RAD kits were less sensitive than RT-PCR, understanding 
the clinical characteristics of different RAD kits can guide us to obtain 
suitable specimens for testing. The likelihood of positive results for RAD kits 
will be higher.

COVID-19 vaccine mandates: what are the current European public perspectives?

The article aims to elaborate on European policy choices for the prevention of 
SARS‑CoV‑2 contagion, with a close focus on the rules and regulations enacted in 
Italy so far. European states have ruled out generalized vaccination mandates 
but have so far preferred to exert a form of "moral suasion", through the 
introduction of a digital certificate which can only be granted to those who are 
vaccinated, cured of COVID-19 or tested negative through an antigen test in the 
previous 48 hours. Italy has applied this tool, dubbed "Green Pass", very 
rigorously: many daily activities, including going to work, are only allowed for 
those who have the certificate. A one-year Green Pass is issued after 
vaccination, although data show that vaccine protection may subside gradually 
over about six months; the cost of the antigen tests every 48 hours is to be 
borne by the patient. Testing the unvaccinated is essential to contain the 
spread of the infection, but it would have been more logical to mandate that all 
the unvaccinated undergo regular testing (for example every ten days), instead 
of imposing a test every 48 hours only to be allowed to engage in some 
activities. The authors stress that in order to minimize the risk of future 
possible pandemics, prevention strategies are needed, and poor countries need to 
be enabled to vaccinate their populations in order to prevent new variants from 
developing. The pledges made by world leaders in that regard during the recent 
G20 summit must therefore be honored, for the sake of global health that never 
in our lifetime has been so threatened.

The emerging pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected over 
200 countries and resulted in a shortage of diagnostic resources globally. Rapid 
diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital to control the spreading of the disease, which, 
however, is challenged by limited detection capacity and low detection 
efficiency in many parts of the world. The pooling test may offer an economical 
and effective approach to increase the virus testing capacity of medical 
laboratories without requiring more laboratory resources such as laboratory 
workers, testing reagents, and equipment. In this study, the sample pools of 6 
and 10 were detected by a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain 
reaction assay targeting ORF1ab and N genes of the severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Each pool consisted of five or nine 
negative SARS-CoV-2 samples and one positive counterpart with varying viral 
loads. Two different strategies of sample pooling were investigated and the 
results were compared comprehensively. One approach was to pool the viral 
transport medium of the samples in the laboratory, and the other was to pool 
swab samples during the collection process. For swab pooling strategy, 
qualitative results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, specific tests of ORF1ab and N genes, 
remained stable over the different pool sizes. Together, this study demonstrates 
that the swab pooling strategy may serve as an effective and economical approach 
for screening SARS-CoV-2 infections in large populations, especially in 
countries and regions where medical resources are limited during the pandemic 
and may thus be potential for clinical laboratory applications.

BACKGROUND: This study aimed to clarify how SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is related to 
COVID-19 critical condition development and mortality in comparison with other 
predictive markers and scoring systems.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at Yokohama Municipal 
Citizen's Hospital and National Institute of Infectious Diseases. We recruited 
adult patients with COVID-19 admitted between March 2020 and January 2021. We 
compared RNAemia with clinical status on admission including scoring systems 
such as the 4C Mortality, CURB-65, and A-DROP, as well as the Ct value of the 
nasopharyngeal PCR, in predicting COVID-19 mortality and critical condition 
development.
RESULTS: Of the 92 recruited patients (median age, 58; interquartile range, 
45-71 years), 14 (14.9%) had RNAemia. These patients had an older age (median, 
68 years vs. 55.5 years; p = 0.011), higher values of lactated dehydrogenase 
(median, 381 U/L vs. 256.5 U/L, p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (median, 10.9 
mg/dL vs. 3.8 mg/dL; p < 0.001), D-dimer (median, 2.07 μg/mL vs. 1.28 μg/mL; p = 
0.015), lower values of lymphocyte (median, 802/μL vs. 1007/μL, p = 0.025) and 
Ct of the nasopharyngeal PCR assay (median, 20.59 vs. 25.54; p = 0.021) than 
those without RNAemia. Univariate analysis showed RNAemia was associated with 
mortality (odds ratio [OR], 18.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.92-89.76; 
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.7851; p = 0.002) 
and critical condition (OR, 72.00; 95% CI, 12.98-399.29; AUC, 0.8198; p < 
0.001). Plus, multivariate analysis also revealed the association of RNAemia 
with critical condition (adjusted OR, 125.71; 95% CI, 11.47-1377.32; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: On-admission SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia is a potent predictive marker of 
COVID-19 critical condition and mortality. The adjusted OR for critical 
condition was as high as 125.71.

OBJECTIVES: The accurate detection of severe acute respiratory 
syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is essential for the diagnosis of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We compared the quantitative RT-PCR results 
between nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva specimens.
METHODS: A COVID-19 outbreak occurred on a cruise ship at Nagasaki port, Japan. 
We obtained 123 nasopharyngeal swabs and saliva each from asymptomatic or mild 
patients in the late phase of infection.
RESULTS: The intervals from the diagnosis to the sampling were 25.5 days for 
nasopharyngeal swabs and 28.9 days for saliva. The positive rate was 19.5% 
(24/123) for nasopharyngeal swabs and 38.2% (47/123) for saliva (P = 0.48). The 
quantified viral copies (mean ± SEM copies/5 μl) were 9.3±2.6 in nasopharyngeal 
swabs and 920±850 in saliva (P = 0.0006).
CONCLUSIONS: The advantages of saliva specimens include positive rate 
improvement and accurate viral load detection. Saliva may be used as a reliable 
sample for SARS-CoV-2 detection.

BACKGROUND: Viral nucleic acid detection is considered the gold standard for the 
diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 
infection. However, unsuitable sample types and laboratory detection 
kits/methods lead to misdiagnosis, which delays the prevention and control of 
the pandemic.
METHODS: We compared four nucleic acid detection methods [two kinds of reverse 
transcription polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR A: ORF1ab and N testing; 
RT-PCRB: only ORF1ab testing), reverse transcription recombinase aided 
amplification (RT-RAA) and droplet digital RT-PCR (dd-RT-PCR)] using 404 samples 
of 72 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including oropharyngeal swab (OPS), 
nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and saliva after deep cough, to evaluate the best 
sample type and method for SARS-CoV-2 detection.
RESULTS: Among the four methods, dd-RT-PCR exhibited the highest positivity rate 
(93.0%), followed by RT-PCR B (91.2%) and RT-RAA (91.2%), while the positivity 
rate of RT-PCR A was only 71.9%. The viral load in OPS [24.90 copies/test (IQR 
15.58-129.85)] was significantly lower than that in saliva [292.30 copies/test 
(IQR 20.20-8628.55)] and NPS [274.40 copies/test (IQR 33.10-2836.45)]. In 
addition, if OPS samples were tested alone by RT-PCR A, only 21.4% of the 
COVID-19 patients would be considered positive. The accuracy of all methods 
reached nearly 100% when saliva and NPS samples from the same patient were 
tested simultaneously.
CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection methods should be fully evaluated 
before use. High-positivity rate methods such as RT-RAA and dd-RT-PCR should be 
considered when possible. Furthermore, saliva after deep cough and NPS can 
greatly improve the accuracy of the diagnosis, and testing OPS alone is not 
recommended.

PROBLEM: The utility of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct 
) values in the management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 
remains controversial.
METHODS: We assessed the correlation of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Ct values in nasopharyngeal swab samples with the 
oxygen requirements at the time of sample collection. Specimens were tested with 
the Simplexa PCR platform, which targets the SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab and S genes.
RESULTS: We identified 23 COVID-19 patients with 49 Ct values available. While 
Ct values from ORF1ab and S genes were highly correlated for a given specimen, 
there was no correlation between Ct values for any of these target genes and the 
oxygen requirements of the patient at the time of sample collection. We found no 
differences in the initial nor the nadir Ct values between survivors and 
non-survivors or mild/moderate versus severe/critical illness at the maximum 
point of illness.
CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 Ct values have limited value in the management of 
COVID-19.

The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 before and shortly after the onset of 
symptoms suggests that only diagnosing and isolating symptomatic patients may 
not be sufficient to interrupt the spread of infection; therefore, public health 
measures such as personal distancing are also necessary. Additionally, it will 
be important to detect the newly infected individuals who remain asymptomatic, 
which may account for 50% or more of the cases. Molecular techniques are the 
"gold standard" for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the massive 
use of these techniques has generated some problems. On the one hand, the 
scarcity of resources (analyzers, fungibles and reagents), and on the other the 
delay in the notification of results. These two facts translate into a lag in 
the application of isolation measures among cases and contacts, which favors the 
spread of the infection. Antigen detection tests are also direct diagnostic 
methods, with the advantage of obtaining the result in a few minutes and at the 
very "pointof-care". Furthermore, the simplicity and low cost of these tests 
allow them to be repeated on successive days in certain clinical settings. The 
sensitivity of antigen tests is generally lower than that of nucleic acid tests, 
although their specificity is comparable. Antigenic tests have been shown to be 
more valid in the days around the onset of symptoms, when the viral load in the 
nasopharynx is higher. Having a rapid and real-time viral detection assay such 
as the antigen test has been shown to be more useful to control the spread of 
the infection than more sensitive tests, but with greater cost and response 
time, such as in case of molecular tests. The main health institutions such as 
the WHO, the CDC and the Ministry of Health of the Government of Spain propose 
the use of antigenic tests in a wide variety of strategies to respond to the 
pandemic. This document aims to support physicians involved in the care of 
patients with suspected SC2 infection, in the context of a growing incidence in 
Spain since September 2020, which already represents the second pandemic wave of 
COVID-19.

Several rapid antigen tests (RATs) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were 
evaluated recently. However, reliable performance data for laboratory-based, 
high-throughput antigen tests are lacking. Therefore and in response to a 
short-term shortage of PCR reagents, we evaluated DiaSorin's LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 
antigen test in comparison to RT-qPCR, and concerning the application of 
screening non-COVID-19 patients on hospital admission. Applying the 
manufacturer-recommended cut-off of 200 arbitrary units (AU/mL) the specificity 
of the LIAISON Test was 100%, the overall analytical sensitivity 40.2%. Lowering 
the cut-off to 100 AU/mL increased the sensitivity to 49.7% and decreased the 
specificity to 98.3%. Confining the analysis to samples with an RT-qPCR 
result < 25 Ct resulted in a sensitivity of 91.2%. The quality of the LIAISON 
test is very similar to that of good RATs described in the literature with the 
advantage of high throughput and the disadvantage of relatively long analysis 
time. It passes the WHO quality criteria for rapid antigen tests and is 
characterized by particularly high specificity. The LIAISON test can therefore 
be used for the same applications as recommended for RATs by the WHO. Due to 
limited sensitivity, the LIAISON test should only be used for screening, if 
PCR-based assays are not available.

BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 testing capacity is important to monitor epidemic 
dynamics and as a mitigation strategy. Given difficulties of large-scale 
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) 
implementation, rapid antigen tests (Rapid Ag-T) have been proposed as 
alternatives in settings like Mexico. Here, we evaluated diagnostic performance 
of Rapid Ag-T for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its associated clinical implications 
compared to qRT-PCR testing in Mexico.
METHODS: We analyzed data from the COVID-19 registry of the Mexican General 
Directorate of Epidemiology up to April 30th, 2021 (n = 6,632,938) and cases 
with both qRT-PCR and Rapid Ag-T (n = 216,388). We evaluated diagnostic 
performance using accuracy measures and assessed time-dependent changes in the 
Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC). We also explored 
test discordances as predictors of hospitalization, intubation, severe COVID-19 
and mortality.
RESULTS: Rapid Ag-T is primarily used in Mexico City. Rapid Ag-T have low 
sensitivity 37.6% (95%CI 36.6-38.7), high specificity 95.5% (95%CI 95.1-95.8) 
and acceptable positive 86.1% (95%CI 85.0-86.6) and negative predictive values 
67.2% (95%CI 66.2-69.2). Rapid Ag-T has optimal diagnostic performance up to 
days 3 after symptom onset, and its performance is modified by testing location, 
comorbidity, and age. qRT-PCR (-) / Rapid Ag-T (+) cases had higher risk of 
adverse COVID-19 outcomes (HR 1.54 95% CI 1.41-1.68) and were older, qRT-PCR 
(+)/ Rapid Ag-T(-) cases had slightly higher risk or adverse outcomes and ≥7 
days from symptom onset (HR 1.53 95% CI 1.48-1.59). Cases detected with rapid 
Ag-T were younger, without comorbidities, and milder COVID-19 course.
CONCLUSIONS: Rapid Ag-T could be used as an alternative to qRT-PCR for large 
scale SARS-CoV-2 testing in Mexico. Interpretation of Rapid Ag-T results should 
be done with caution to minimize the risk associated with false negative 
results.

The most widely used test for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is a PCR 
test. PCR has very high sensitivity and is able to detect very low amounts of 
RNA. However, many individuals receiving a positive test result in a context of 
a PCR-based surveillance might be infected with SARS-CoV-2, but they are not 
contagious at the time of the test. The question arises regards if the cost 
effective, portable rapid antigen tests (RATs) have a better performance than 
PCR in identification of infectious individuals. In this direction, we examined 
the diagnostic performance of RATs from 14 different manufacturers in 400 
clinical samples with known rRT-PCR cycles threshold (cT) and 50 control 
samples. Substantial variability was observed in the limit of detection (LOD) of 
different RATs (cT = 26.8-34.7). The fluorescence-based RAT exhibited a LOD of 
cT = 34.7. The use of the most effective RATs leads to true positive rates 
(sensitivities) of 99.1% and 90.9% for samples with cT ≤ 30 and cT ≤ 33, 
respectively, percentages that can guarantee a sensitivity high enough to 
identify contagious patients. RAT testing may also substantially reduce the 
quarantine period for infected individuals without compromising personal or 
public safety.

PURPOSE: With over 50 SARS-CoV-2 gene amplification assays that have been EUA 
cleared with minimal experimental validation performed, it is likely that not 
all of these assays are comparable in their ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in 
clinical specimens. Thermo Fisher Scientific is a relatively new company in the 
molecular diagnostics field and the purpose of this study was to compare the 
performance of the Thermo Fisher TaqPath™ Combo Kit with an established test, 
the Cepheid Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay, for its ability to detect SARS-CoV-2 
in nasopharyngeal specimens.
METHODS: A total of 300 randomly selected nasopharyngeal specimens were 
evaluated and tested by the TaqPath and GeneXpert assays. Discordant test 
specimens were arbitrated by performing an alternative PCR assay and Sanger 
sequencing.
RESULTS: The TaqPath assay had a 96.7 and 99.6% positive and negative agreement 
respectively when compared to the Xpert Xpress test. However, after test 
arbitration, the three discordant specimens were arbitrated in favor of the 
TaqPath assay producing a positive and negative percent agreement of 100% for 
the TaqPath Combo Kit while the Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay had a positive and 
negative percent agreement of 98.3 and 99.2% respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The TaqPath Combo Kit is a high complexity assay that compares 
favorably with the Xpert Xpress test and can be reliably used for the detection 
of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal specimens.

Quick identification and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals is central 
to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Real time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) 
is the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, this resource-intensive 
and relatively lengthy technique is not ideally suited for mass testing. While 
pooled testing offers substantial savings in cost and time, the size of the 
optimum pool that offers complete concordance with results of individualized 
testing remains elusive. To determine the optimum pool size, we first evaluated 
the utility of pool testing using simulated 5-sample pools with varying 
proportions of positive and negative samples. We observed that 5-sample pool 
testing resulted in false negativity rate of 5% when the pools contained one 
positive sample. We then examined the diagnostic performance of 4-sample pools 
in the operational setting of a diagnostic laboratory using 500 consecutive 
samples in 125 pools. With background prevalence of 2.4%, this 4-sample pool 
testing showed 100% concordance with individualized testing and resulted in 66% 
and 59% reduction in resource and turnaround time, respectively. Since the 
negative predictive value of a diagnostic test varies inversely with prevalence, 
we re-tested the 4-sample pooling strategy using a fresh batch of 500 samples in 
125 pools when the prevalence rose to 12.7% and recorded 100% concordance and 
reduction in cost and turnaround time by 36% and 30%, respectively. These 
observations led us to conclude that 4-sample pool testing offers the optimal 
blend of resource optimization and diagnostic performance across difference 
disease prevalence settings.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) anti-spike (S) IgG antibody production after vaccination with 
BNT162b2 and the protection from symptomatic breakthrough infections in health 
care workers.
METHODS: This prospective observational study (RENAISSANCE) had as a primary end 
point the evaluation of serologic response to BNT162b2 14 days after a second 
dose. SARS-CoV-2 anti-S IgG antibodies were evaluated with LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 
TrimericS IgG assay (DiaSorin S.p.A.), which is able to detect the presence of 
both binding and neutralizing antibodies for trimeric spike glycoprotein. 
Participants were recruited from February 1, 2021, to February 22, 2021. 
Occurrence of vaccine breakthrough infections was assessed by reverse 
transcription-polymerase chain reaction on symptomatic and contact cases up to 
June 6, 2021.
RESULTS: Of 2569 staff evaluated, only 4 were nonresponders (0.16%; 95% CI, 
0.04% to 0.41%). All 4 nonresponders were severely immunosuppressed and 
receiving treatment with mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid. At 14 days 
after the second dose, 67.5% (1733) of staff had anti-S IgG titers of 2000 
BAU/mL or higher; 19.2% (494), between 1500 and 2000 BAU/mL; 9.8% (251), between 
1000 and 1500 BAU/mL; and 3.4% (87), 1000 BAU/mL or lower. Women had a higher 
probability of having higher titers than men (64.5% [1044/1618] vs 58.3% 
[410/703]; P=.005). This was confirmed after adjustment for age group (odds 
ratio, 1.275; 95% CI, 1.062 to 1.531; P=.009). Four months after the end of the 
vaccination program, only 13 participants (0.26%) had experienced a breakthrough 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, including 1 nonresponder. This was the only participant 
requiring hospitalization for severe COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: The vaccination campaign among health care workers at the ASST GOM 
Niguarda has resulted in a marked serologic response and reduction of incident 
COVID-19 cases. Yet, the lack of protection should not be overlooked in 
immunocompromised individuals.

The accurate laboratory detection of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a crucial element in the fight against coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing 
on combined oral and nasopharyngeal swab (ONPS) suffers from several 
limitations, including the need for qualified personnel, the discomfort caused 
by invasive nasopharyngeal sample collection, and the possibility of swab and 
transport media shortage. Testing on saliva would represent an advancement. The 
aim of this study was to compare the concordance between saliva samples and ONPS 
for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 on various commercial and laboratory-developed 
tests (LDT). Individuals were recruited from eight institutions in Quebec, 
Canada, if they had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected on a recently collected ONPS, and 
accepted to provide another ONPS, paired with saliva. Assays available in the 
different laboratories (Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2, Cobas® SARS-CoV-2, Simplexa™ 
COVID-19 Direct, Allplex™ 2019-nCoV, RIDA®GENE SARS-CoV-2, and an LDT preceded 
by three different extraction methods) were used to determine the concordance 
between saliva and ONPS results. Overall, 320 tests were run from a total of 125 
saliva and ONPS sample pairs. All assays yielded similar sensitivity when saliva 
was compared to ONPS, with the exception of one LDT (67% vs. 93%). The mean 
difference in cycle threshold (∆C t ) was generally (but not significantly) in 
favor of the ONPS for all nucleic acid amplification tests. The maximum mean 
∆​​​​​C t was 2.0, while individual ∆C t varied importantly from -17.5 to 12.4. 
Saliva seems to be associated with sensitivity similar to ONPS for the detection 
of SARS-CoV-2 by various assays.

OBJECTIVES: A seroprevalence study of severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was conducted in a high-incidence area located in 
northeastern Italy.
METHODS: All citizens above 10 years of age resident in five municipalities of 
the Autonomous Province of Trento, with the highest incidence of coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, were invited to participate in the study. Among 
6098 participants, 6075 sera and a standardized questionnaire administered 
face-to-face were collected between 5 May and 15 May 2020 and examined. 
Symptomatic individuals and their family contacts were tested by RT-PCR. 
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected using an Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay, 
which was performed on the Abbott Architect i2000SR automated analyser. 
Seroprevalence was calculated as the proportion of positive results among the 
total number tested. A multivariable logistic regression model was performed to 
assess the relationship between seropositive versus seronegative individuals for 
a set of explanatory variables.
RESULTS: A total of 1402 participants were positive for IgG antibodies against 
SARS-CoV-2, with a prevalence of 23.1% (1402/6075). The highest prevalence was 
found in the age class 40-49 years. Overall, 34.4% (2096/6098) of the 
participants reported at least one symptom. The ratio between reported cases 
identified by molecular test and those with seropositive results was 1:3, with a 
maximum ratio of about 1:7 in the age group <20 years and a minimum around 1:1 
in those >70 years old. The infection fatality rate was 2.5% (35/1402). Among 
the symptoms, anosmia and ageusia were strongly associated with seropositivity.
CONCLUSIONS: The estimated seroprevalence of 23% was three-fold higher than the 
number of cases reported in the COVID-19 Integrated Surveillance data in the 
study area. This may be explained in part by a relatively high number of 
individuals presenting mild or no illness, especially those of younger age, and 
people who did not seek medical care or testing, but who may contribute to virus 
transmission in the community.

The worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
outbreak has led to the rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The 
quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) is widely used as the gold standard for 
clinical detection of SARS-CoV-2. However, more and more infected patients are 
relapsing after discharge, which suggests qPCR may fail to detect the virus in 
some cases. In this study, we selected 74 clinical samples from 43 recovering 
inpatients for qPCR and Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) synchronous blind detection, 
and established a cutoff value for ddPCR diagnosis of COVID-19. The results 
showed that at a cutoff value of 0.04 copies/μL, the ddPCR sensitivity and 
specificity are 97.6% and 100%, respectively. In addition, we also analyzed 18 
retained samples from 9 discharged patients who relapsed. Although qPCR showed 
all 18 samples to be negative, ddPCR showed 12 to be positive, and there was 
only one patient with two negative samples; the other eight patients had at 
least one positive sample. These results indicate that ddPCR could significantly 
improve the accuracy of COVID-19 diagnosis, especially for discharged patients 
with a low viral load, and help to reduce misdiagnosis during recovery.

The prevalence and clinical relevance of viremia in patients with coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) have not been well studied. A prospective cohort study 
was designed to investigate blood viral load and clearance kinetics in 52 
patients (median age, 62 years; 31 [59.6%] male) and explore their association 
with clinical features and outcomes based on a novel one-step RT droplet digital 
PCR (RT-ddPCR). By using one-step RT-ddPCR, 92.3% (48 of 52) of this cohort was 
quantitatively detected with viremia. The concordance between the blood and 
oropharyngeal swab tests was 60.92% (53 of 87). One-step RT-ddPCR was tested 
with a 3.03% false-positive rate and lower 50% confidence interval of detection 
at 54.026 copies/mL plasma. There was no reduction in the blood viral load in 
all critical patients, whereas the general and severe patients exhibited a 
similar ability to clear the viral load. The viral loads in critical patients 
were significantly higher than those in their general and severe counterparts. 
Among the 52 study patients, 30 (58%) were discharged from the hospital. Among 
half of the 30 discharged patients, blood viral load remained positive, of which 
76.9% (10 of 13) completely cleared their blood viral load at follow-up. 
Meanwhile, none of their close contacts had evidence of infection. Quantitative 
determination of the blood viral test is of great clinical significance in the 
management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

The diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is mainly based on a 
positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase 
chain reaction (PCR) result. PCR samples are obtained from upper or lower 
respiratory tract specimens. However, the sensitivity of PCR is known to have 
some limitations. We report on a patient who was admitted to our hospital with 
dyspnea, fever, cough, and history of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infected 
relative. The initial chest computed tomography (CT) showed only minimal changes 
and SARS-CoV-2 PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab sample was negative. PCR results 
obtained from further nasopharyngeal swabs, qualified sputum samples, and from a 
lower respiratory tract specimen also remained negative. At day 13 after 
admission, a second chest CT showed radiological findings suspicious for viral 
pneumonia. Finally, serologic results showed high levels of immunoglobulin G and 
immunoglobulin A antibodies against the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia.

BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) are increasingly 
being integrated in testing strategies around the world. Studies of the Ag-RDTs 
have shown variable performance. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we 
assessed the clinical accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of commercially 
available Ag-RDTs.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We registered the review on PROSPERO (registration number: 
CRD42020225140). We systematically searched multiple databases (PubMed, Web of 
Science Core Collection, medRvix, bioRvix, and FIND) for publications evaluating 
the accuracy of Ag-RDTs for SARS-CoV-2 up until 30 April 2021. Descriptive 
analyses of all studies were performed, and when more than 4 studies were 
available, a random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled 
sensitivity and specificity in comparison to reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. We assessed heterogeneity by subgroup analyses, 
and rated study quality and risk of bias using the QUADAS-2 assessment tool. 
From a total of 14,254 articles, we included 133 analytical and clinical studies 
resulting in 214 clinical accuracy datasets with 112,323 samples. Across all 
meta-analyzed samples, the pooled Ag-RDT sensitivity and specificity were 71.2% 
(95% CI 68.2% to 74.0%) and 98.9% (95% CI 98.6% to 99.1%), respectively. 
Sensitivity increased to 76.3% (95% CI 73.1% to 79.2%) if analysis was 
restricted to studies that followed the Ag-RDT manufacturers' instructions. 
LumiraDx showed the highest sensitivity, with 88.2% (95% CI 59.0% to 97.5%). Of 
instrument-free Ag-RDTs, Standard Q nasal performed best, with 80.2% sensitivity 
(95% CI 70.3% to 87.4%). Across all Ag-RDTs, sensitivity was markedly better on 
samples with lower RT-PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values, i.e., <20 (96.5%, 95% CI 
92.6% to 98.4%) and <25 (95.8%, 95% CI 92.3% to 97.8%), in comparison to those 
with Ct ≥ 25 (50.7%, 95% CI 35.6% to 65.8%) and ≥30 (20.9%, 95% CI 12.5% to 
32.8%). Testing in the first week from symptom onset resulted in substantially 
higher sensitivity (83.8%, 95% CI 76.3% to 89.2%) compared to testing after 1 
week (61.5%, 95% CI 52.2% to 70.0%). The best Ag-RDT sensitivity was found with 
anterior nasal sampling (75.5%, 95% CI 70.4% to 79.9%), in comparison to other 
sample types (e.g., nasopharyngeal, 71.6%, 95% CI 68.1% to 74.9%), although CIs 
were overlapping. Concerns of bias were raised across all datasets, and 
financial support from the manufacturer was reported in 24.1% of datasets. Our 
analysis was limited by the included studies' heterogeneity in design and 
reporting.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found that Ag-RDTs detect the vast majority of 
SARS-CoV-2-infected persons within the first week of symptom onset and those 
with high viral load. Thus, they can have high utility for diagnostic purposes 
in the early phase of disease, making them a valuable tool to fight the spread 
of SARS-CoV-2. Standardization in conduct and reporting of clinical accuracy 
studies would improve comparability and use of data.

methods (ACE2-RBD inhibition assay, S1-IgG detection, RBD-IgG detection, and 
N-IgG detection) were established and evaluated based on chemiluminescence 
technology. For the first time, a broadly neutralizing antibody with high 
affinity was used as a standard for the quantitative detection of SARS-CoV-2 
specific neutralizing antibodies in human sera. Sera from COVID-19 convalescent 
patients (N = 119), vaccinated donors (N = 86), and healthy donors (N = 299) 
confirmed by microneutralization test (MNT) were used to evaluate the above 
methods. The result showed that the ACE2-RBD inhibition assay calculated with 
either ACE2-RBD binding inhibition percentage rate or ACE2-RBD inhibiting 
antibody concentration were strongly correlated with MNT (r ≥ 0.78, p < 0.0001) 
and also highly consistent with MNT (Kappa Value ≥ 0.94, p < 0.01). There was 
also a strong correlation between the two evaluation indices (r ≥ 0.99, p < 
0.0001). Meanwhile, S1-IgG and RBD-IgG quantitative detection were also 
significantly correlated with MNT (r ≥ 0.73, p < 0.0001), and both methods were 
highly correlated with each other (r ≥ 0.95, p < 0.0001). However, the 
concentration of N-IgG antibodies showed a lower correlation with the MNT 
results (r < 0.49, p < 0.0001). The diagnostic assays presented here could be 
used for the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine immunization effect and 
serological diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, and could also have guiding 
significance for establishing other rapid serological methods to surrogate 
neutralization tests for SARS-CoV-2.

Highly accurate testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) at the point of care (POC) is an unmet diagnostic need in emergency 
care and time-sensitive outpatient care settings. Reverse transcription-PCR 
(RT-PCR) technology is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics. We 
performed a multisite U.S. study comparing the clinical performance of the first 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-authorized POC RT-PCR for detection of 
SARS-CoV-2 in 20 min, the cobas Liat SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A/B nucleic acid 
test, to the most widely used RT-PCR laboratory test, the cobas 68/8800 
SARS-CoV-2 test. Clinical nasopharyngeal swab specimens from 444 patients with 
357 evaluable specimens at five U.S. clinical laboratories were enrolled from 21 
September 2020 to 23 October 2020. The overall agreement between the Liat and 
68/8800 systems for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics was 98.6% (352/357). Using Liat, 
positive percent agreement for SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (162/162) and the negative 
percent agreement was 97.4% (190/195). The Liat is an RT-PCR POC test that 
provides highly accurate SARS-CoV-2 results in 20 min with performance 
equivalent to that of high-throughput laboratory molecular testing. Rapid RT-PCR 
testing at the POC can enable more timely infection control and individual care 
decisions for coronavirus disease 2019.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 infections often 
cause only mild disease that may evoke relatively low Ab titers compared with 
patients admitted to hospitals. Generally, total Ab bridging assays combine good 
sensitivity with high specificity. Therefore, we developed sensitive total Ab 
bridging assays for detection of SARS-CoV-2 Abs to the receptor-binding domain 
(RBD) and nucleocapsid protein in addition to conventional isotype-specific 
assays. Ab kinetics was assessed in PCR-confirmed, hospitalized coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (n = 41) and three populations of patients with 
COVID-19 symptoms not requiring hospital admission: PCR-confirmed convalescent 
plasmapheresis donors (n = 182), PCR-confirmed hospital care workers (n = 47), 
and a group of longitudinally sampled symptomatic individuals highly suspect of 
COVID-19 (n = 14). In nonhospitalized patients, the Ab response to RBD is weaker 
but follows similar kinetics, as has been observed in hospitalized patients. 
Across populations, the RBD bridging assay identified most patients correctly as 
seropositive. In 11/14 of the COVID-19-suspect cases, seroconversion in the RBD 
bridging assay could be demonstrated before day 12; nucleocapsid protein Abs 
emerged less consistently. Furthermore, we demonstrated the feasibility of 
finger-prick sampling for Ab detection against SARS-CoV-2 using these assays. In 
conclusion, the developed bridging assays reliably detect SARS-CoV-2 Abs in 
hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients and are therefore well suited to 
conduct seroprevalence studies.

BACKGROUND: Molecular-based tests used to identify symptomatic or asymptomatic 
patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 are characterized by high specificity but scarce 
sensitivity, generating false-negative results. We aimed to estimate, through a 
systematic review of the literature, the rate of RT-PCR false negatives at 
initial testing for COVID-19.
METHODS: We systematically searched Pubmed, Embase and CENTRAL as well as a list 
of reference literature. We included observational studies that collected 
samples from respiratory tract to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-PCR, reporting 
the number of false-negative subjects and the number of final patients with a 
COVID-19 diagnosis. Reported rates of false negatives were pooled in a 
meta-analysis as appropriate. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies 
and graded the quality of evidence according to the GRADE method. All 
information in this article is current up to February 2021.
RESULTS: We included 32 studies, enrolling more than 18,000 patients infected by 
SARS-CoV-2. The overall false-negative rate was 0.12 (95%CI from 0.10 to 0.14) 
with very low certainty of evidence. The impact of misdiagnoses was estimated 
according to disease prevalence; a range between 2 and 58/1,000 subjects could 
be misdiagnosed with a disease prevalence of 10%, increasing to 
290/1,000 misdiagnosed subjects with a disease prevalence of 50%.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review showed that up to 58% of COVID-19 patients 
may have initial false-negative RT-PCR results, suggesting the need to implement 
a correct diagnostic strategy to correctly identify suspected cases, thereby 
reducing false-negative results and decreasing the disease burden among the 
population.

Update of
    medRxiv. 2020 Nov 22;:

The association of mortality with the early humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 
infection within the first few days after onset of symptoms (DAOS) has not been 
thoroughly investigated partly due to a lack of sufficiently sensitive antibody 
testing methods. Here we report two sensitive and automated testing-on-a-probe 
(TOP) biosensor assays for SARS-CoV-2 viral specific total antibodies (TAb) and 
surrogate neutralizing antibodies (SNAb), which are suitable for clinical use. 
The TOP assays employ an RBD-coated quartz probe using a 
Cy5-Streptavidin-polysacharide conjugate to improve sensitivity and minimize 
interference. Disposable cartridges containing pre-dispensed reagents require no 
liquid manipulation or fluidics during testing. The TOP-TAb assay exhibited 
higher sensitivity in the 0-7 DAOS window than a widely used FDA-EUA assay. The 
rapid and automated TOP-SNAb correlated well with two well-established 
SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization tests. The clinical utility of the TOP assays 
was demonstrated by evaluating early antibody responses in 120 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR 
positive adult hospitalized patients. Higher TAb and SNAb positivity rates and 
more robust antibody responses at patient's initial hospital presentation were 
seen in inpatients who survived COVID-19 than those who died in the hospital. 
Survival analysis using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model showed that patients 
who had negative TAb and/or SNAb at initial hospital presentation were at a 
higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Furthermore, TAb and SNAb levels at 
presentation were inversely associated with SARS-CoV-2 viral load based on 
concurrent RT-PCR testing. Overall, the sensitive and automated TAb and SNAb 
assays allow the detection of early SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which associate with 
mortality.

Increasing the diagnostic capacity for COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 infection) is 
required to improve case detection, reduce COVID-19 expansion, and boost the 
world economy. Rapid antigen detection tests are less expensive and easier to 
implement, but their diagnostic performance has been questioned compared to 
reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Here, we evaluate the performance of the 
Standard Q COVID-19 antigen test for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
predicting contagiousness compared to RT-PCR and viral culture, respectively. 
The antigen test was 100.0% specific but only 40.9% sensitive for diagnosing 
infection compared to RT-PCR. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 contagiousness is highly 
unlikely with a negative antigen test since it exhibited a negative predictive 
value of 99.9% compared to viral culture. Furthermore, a cycle threshold (CT) 
value of 18.1 in RT-PCR was shown to be the one that best predicts 
contagiousness (area under the curve [AUC], 97.6%). Thus, screening people with 
antigen testing is a good approach to prevent SARS-CoV-2 contagion and allow 
returning to daily activities. IMPORTANCE The importance of our results is the 
excellent agreement between the Standard Q COVID-19 antigen test and the viral 
culture, indicating that it is important as a marker of contagiousness. Due to 
its high positive predictive value in situations of a high prevalence of 
infection, positive results do not require confirmation with another test. 
Likewise, its high negative predictive value for contagiousness makes possible 
to use this test as a criterion to discharge patients in isolation and screen 
people moving into environments that could facilitate the transmission of the 
virus. Screening people with antigen testing is a good approach to prevent 
SARS-CoV-2 contagion and allow returning to daily activities.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a life-threatening respiratory infection 
caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2), a novel human 
coronavirus. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization in 
March 2020 for its continuous and rapid spread worldwide. Rapidly emerging 
COVID-19 epicenters and mutants of concerns have created mammoth chaos in 
healthcare sectors across the globe. With over 185 million infections and 
approximately 4 million deaths globally, COVID-19 continues its unchecked spread 
despite all mitigation measures. Until effective and affordable antiretroviral 
drugs are made available and the population at large is vaccinated, timely 
diagnosis of the infection and adoption of COVID-appropriate behavior remains 
major tool available to curtail the still escalating COVID-19 pandemic. This 
review provides an updated overview of various techniques of COVID-19 testing in 
human samples and also discusses, in brief, the biochemical composition and mode 
of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Technological advancement in various 
molecular, serological and immunological techniques including mainly the 
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), CRISPR, lateral flow 
assays (LFAs), and immunosensors are reviewed.

BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has 
caused a global pandemic in 2020. Testing is crucial for mitigating public 
health and economic effects. Serology is considered key to population-level 
surveillance and potentially individual-level risk assessment. However, 
immunoassay performance has not been compared on large, identical sample sets. 
We aimed to investigate the performance of four high-throughput commercial 
SARS-CoV-2 antibody immunoassays and a novel 384-well ELISA.
METHODS: We did a head-to-head assessment of SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott, 
Chicago, IL, USA), LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay (DiaSorin, Saluggia, 
Italy), Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), SARS-CoV-2 
Total assay (Siemens, Munich, Germany), and a novel 384-well ELISA (the Oxford 
immunoassay). We derived sensitivity and specificity from 976 pre-pandemic blood 
samples (collected between Sept 4, 2014, and Oct 4, 2016) and 536 blood samples 
from patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collected at least 
20 days post symptom onset (collected between Feb 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020). 
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess assay 
thresholds.
FINDINGS: At the manufacturers' thresholds, for the Abbott assay sensitivity was 
92·7% (95% CI 90·2-94·8) and specificity was 99·9% (99·4-100%); for the DiaSorin 
assay sensitivity was 96·2% (94·2-97·7) and specificity was 98·9% (98·0-99·4); 
for the Oxford immunoassay sensitivity was 99·1% (97·8-99·7) and specificity was 
99·0% (98·1-99·5); for the Roche assay sensitivity was 97·2% (95·4-98·4) and 
specificity was 99·8% (99·3-100); and for the Siemens assay sensitivity was 
98·1% (96·6-99·1) and specificity was 99·9% (99·4-100%). All assays achieved a 
sensitivity of at least 98% with thresholds optimised to achieve a specificity 
of at least 98% on samples taken 30 days or more post symptom onset.
INTERPRETATION: Four commercial, widely available assays and a scalable 384-well 
ELISA can be used for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing to achieve sensitivity and 
specificity of at least 98%. The Siemens assay and Oxford immunoassay achieved 
these metrics without further optimisation. This benchmark study in immunoassay 
assessment should enable refinements of testing strategies and the best use of 
serological testing resource to benefit individuals and population health.

AIM: To evaluate the nucleic acid and antibody test results of patients with 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China.
METHODS: All patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from Jan to 
Apr 2020were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics and laboratory 
test results were obtained from electronic medical records. Patients were 
divided into three groups based on antibody production, and compared for 
laboratory test results.
RESULTS: Of 73 patients aged11-82 years, 12 (16.4%), 28 (38.4%), 25 (34.2%) and 
8 (11.0%)were ≤ 30, 31-50, 51-70,and ≥ 71 years old, respectively. Thirty-four 
(46.6%) patients were male. Most individuals had mild symptoms, and no patient 
died during treatment. All patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 
sputum and nasopharyngeal samples, and 40 (54.8%) were also tested positive in 
stool. Nine(12.3%) patients were re-positivefor SARS-CoV-2, as assessed by 
Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) after discharge. 
Sixty-five (89.0%) patients had IgM or IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.Among 
the four age groups, there was no difference in IgG antibody production 
(P = 0.664).CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19 cell counts between the antibody producing 
and non-producing groups showed no significant differences (all P > 0.05).The 
antibodies disappeared within two months in four patients. Lymphocyte count, 
C-reactive protein, IL-6, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, 
creatinine and D-Dimer levels were similar in the three groups (all P > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients after recovery from COVID-19 can be tested positive for 
SARS-CoV-2.Some patients may produce antibodies only for a short time, or even 
no antibodies at all.

IMPORTANCE: Understanding the effect of serum antibodies to severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on susceptibility to infection 
is important for identifying at-risk populations and could have implications for 
vaccine deployment.
OBJECTIVE: The study purpose was to evaluate evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
based on diagnostic nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) among patients with 
positive vs negative test results for antibodies in an observational descriptive 
cohort study of clinical laboratory and linked claims data.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The study created cohorts from a deidentified 
data set composed of commercial laboratory tests, medical and pharmacy claims, 
electronic health records, and hospital chargemaster data. Patients were 
categorized as antibody-positive or antibody-negative according to their first 
SARS-CoV-2 antibody test in the database.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end points were post-index diagnostic NAAT 
results, with infection defined as a positive diagnostic test post-index, 
measured in 30-day intervals (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, >90 days). Additional measures 
included demographic, geographic, and clinical characteristics at the time of 
the index antibody test, including recorded signs and symptoms or prior evidence 
of coronavirus 2019 (COVID) diagnoses or positive NAAT results and recorded 
comorbidities.
RESULTS: The cohort included 3 257 478 unique patients with an index antibody 
test; 56% were female with a median (SD) age of 48 (20) years. Of these, 
2 876 773 (88.3%) had a negative index antibody result, and 378 606 (11.6%) had 
a positive index antibody result. Patients with a negative antibody test result 
were older than those with a positive result (mean age 48 vs 44 years). Of 
index-positive patients, 18.4% converted to seronegative over the follow-up 
period. During the follow-up periods, the ratio (95% CI) of positive NAAT 
results among individuals who had a positive antibody test at index vs those 
with a negative antibody test at index was 2.85 (95% CI, 2.73-2.97) at 0 to 30 
days, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.6-0.74) at 31 to 60 days, 0.29 (95% CI, 0.24-0.35) at 61 
to 90 days, and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.05-0.19) at more than 90 days.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, patients with positive antibody 
test results were initially more likely to have positive NAAT results, 
consistent with prolonged RNA shedding, but became markedly less likely to have 
positive NAAT results over time, suggesting that seropositivity is associated 
with protection from infection. The duration of protection is unknown, and 
protection may wane over time.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) instigated by severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more`` than 20 million people, 
with more than more than 700000 deaths globally; and has been declared a 
pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is recognized as the seventh coronavirus affecting Homo 
sapiens. The symptoms of COVID-19 consist of an elevated temperature, cough, 
diarrhea, and vomiting amongst others, whereas the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is 
believed to arise via release of respiratory secretions; through sneezing and 
coughing. COVID-19 is identified via X-ray or computed tomography scans and 
further corroborated with molecular diagnostics techniques, including polymerase 
chain reaction. At present there are no successful therapeutics against 
SARS-CoV-2; existing antiviral therapies have been utilized to hinder 
manifestation of respiratory difficulties by diminishing viral load. Herein, we 
depict an extensive update on the clinical aspects of COVID-19, including 
strategies for the regulation of the transmission, diagnosis, treatment, and 
pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infections.

A versatile portfolio of diagnostic tests is essential for the containment of 
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. 
Besides nucleic acid-based test systems and point-of-care (POCT) antigen (Ag) 
tests, quantitative, laboratory-based nucleocapsid Ag tests for SARS-CoV-2 have 
recently been launched. Here, we evaluated four commercial Ag tests on automated 
platforms and one POCT to detect SARS-CoV-2. We evaluated PCR-positive (n = 107) 
and PCR-negative (n = 303) respiratory swabs from asymptomatic and symptomatic 
patients at the end of the second pandemic wave in Germany (February-March 2021) 
as well as clinical isolates EU1 (B.1.117), variant of concern (VOC) Alpha 
(B.1.1.7) or Beta (B.1.351), which had been expanded in a biosafety level 3 
laboratory. The specificities of automated SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests ranged between 
97.0 and 99.7% (Lumipulse G SARS-CoV-2 Ag (Fujirebio): 97.03%, Elecsys 
SARS-CoV-2 Ag (Roche Diagnostics): 97.69%; LIAISON® SARS-CoV-2 Ag (Diasorin) and 
SARS-CoV-2 Ag ELISA (Euroimmun): 99.67%). In this study cohort of hospitalized 
patients, the clinical sensitivities of tests were low, ranging from 17.76 to 
52.34%, and analytical sensitivities ranged from 420,000 to 25,000,000 Geq/ml. 
In comparison, the detection limit of the Roche Rapid Ag Test (RAT) was 
9,300,000 Geq/ml, detecting 23.58% of respiratory samples. 
Receiver-operating-characteristics (ROCs) and Youden's index analyses were 
performed to further characterize the assays' overall performance and determine 
optimal assay cutoffs for sensitivity and specificity. VOCs carrying up to four 
amino acid mutations in nucleocapsid were detected by all five assays with 
characteristics comparable to non-VOCs. In summary, automated, quantitative 
SARS-CoV-2 Ag tests show variable performance and are not necessarily superior 
to a standard POCT. The efficacy of any alternative testing strategies to 
complement nucleic acid-based assays must be carefully evaluated by independent 
laboratories prior to widespread implementation.

BACKGROUND: The recent outbreak by a novel coronavirus originated from Wuhan, 
China in 2019, and is progressively spreading to other countries. Timely 
diagnosis of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) improves the survival of 
the patients and also prevents the transmission of the infection. In this study, 
we reviewed the applicable and available methods for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
METHODS: For the review, we systematically searched Web of Science, PubMed, and 
Iranian articles that were published about COVID-19 diagnostic methods with a 
combination of the key terms: laboratory, radiological, tests, coronavirus.
RESULTS: Although the current gold standard diagnostic test for this virus is 
real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the 
occasional false-negative and the low sensitivity of the test should not be 
underestimated. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan is another diagnostic test 
for COVID-19, with higher sensitivity but low specificity. A combination of 
sensitive RT-PCR with a chest CT scan together with the clinical features are 
highly recommended for the proper diagnosis. Notably, there are some other 
sensitive and low-cost tests for evaluation of COVID-19 infection, but their 
validation should be approved.
CONCLUSION: Since early and accurate diagnosis of the viral disease could 
improve the survival rate of the patients, and halt the transmission chain, it 
is not surprising that tremendous attempts should be made to reduce the 
limitations of the tests leading to the false-negative results and to find a 
rapid test for the diagnosis of COVID-19.

BACKGROUND: The Ad5-nCoV vaccine is a single-dose adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) 
vectored vaccine expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that was well-tolerated 
and immunogenic in phase 1 and 2 studies. In this study, we report results on 
the final efficacy and interim safety analyses of the phase 3 trial.
METHODS: This double-blind, randomised, international, placebo-controlled, 
endpoint-case driven, phase 3, clinical trial enrolled adults aged 18 years 
older at study centres in Argentina, Chile, Mexico, Pakistan, and Russia. 
Participants were eligible for the study if they had no unstable or severe 
underlying medical or psychiatric conditions; had no history of a 
laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection; were not pregnant or breastfeeding; 
and had no previous receipt of an adenovirus-vectored, coronavirus, or 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. After informed consent was obtained, 25 mL of whole blood 
was withdrawn from all eligible participants who were randomised in a 1:1 ratio 
to receive a single intramuscular dose of 0·5 mL placebo or a 0·5 mL dose of 
5 × 1010 viral particle (vp)/mL Ad5-nCoV vaccine; study staff and participants 
were blinded to treatment allocation. All participants were contacted weekly by 
email, telephone, or text message to self-report any symptoms of COVID-19 
illness, and laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 was done for all participants 
with any symptoms. The primary efficacy objective evaluated Ad5-nCoV in 
preventing symptomatic, PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection occurring at least 28 
days after vaccination in all participants who were at least 28 days 
postvaccination on Jan 15, 2021. The primary safety objective evaluated the 
incidence of any serious adverse events or medically attended adverse events 
postvaccination in all participants who received a study injection. This trial 
is closed for enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04526990).
FINDINGS: Study enrolment began on Sept 22, 2020, in Pakistan, Nov 6, 2020, in 
Mexico, Dec 2, 2020, in Russia and Chile, and Dec 17, 2020, in Argentina; 150 
endpoint cases were reached on Jan 15, 2021, triggering the final primary 
efficacy analysis. One dose of Ad5-nCoV showed a 57·5% (95% CI 39·7-70·0, 
p=0·0026) efficacy against symptomatic, PCR-confirmed, COVID-19 infection at 28 
days or more postvaccination (21 250 participants; 45 days median duration of 
follow-up [IQR 36-58]). In the primary safety analysis undertaken at the time of 
the efficacy analysis (36 717 participants), there was no significant difference 
in the incidence of serious adverse events (14 [0·1%] of 18 363 Ad5-nCoV 
recipients and 10 [0·1%] of 18 354 placebo recipients, p=0·54) or medically 
attended adverse events (442 [2·4%] of 18 363 Ad5-nCoV recipients and 411 [2·2%] 
of 18 354 placebo recipients, p=0·30) between the Ad5-nCoV or placebo groups, or 
any serious adverse events considered related to the study product (none in both 
Ad5-nCoV and placebo recipients). In the extended safety cohort, 1004 (63·5%) of 
1582 of Ad5-nCoV recipients and 729 (46·4%) of 1572 placebo recipients reported 
a solicited systemic adverse event (p<0·0001), of which headache was the most 
common (699 [44%] of Ad5-nCoV recipients and 481 [30·6%] of placebo recipients; 
p<0·0001). 971 (61·3%) of 1584 Ad5-nCoV recipients and 314 (20·0%) of 1573 
placebo recipients reported an injection-site adverse event (p<0·0001), of which 
pain at the injection site was the most frequent; reported by 939 (59%) Ad5-nCoV 
recipients and 303 (19%) placebo recipients.
INTERPRETATION: One dose of Ad5-nCoV is efficacious and safe in healthy adults 
aged 18 years and older.

The end of 2019 marked the start of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic from 
China, which went on to envelope more than 190 countries and territories across 
the globe. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), from a 
group of betacoronaviruses, is responsible for COVID-19. The virulent factors 
include the presence of envelope and spike proteins having receptor bonding 
domains (RBD). Clinical manifestations can range from mild respiratory 
infections to fatal outcomes. The viability of virus ranges from 3 to 72 hours. 
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the diagnostic test of choice in this 
pandemic situation. Due to the absence of specific antivirals and vaccine, 
adoption of preventive option can help to combat the specific life-threatening 
outcomes.

Almost 80% of people confronting COVID-19 recover from COVID-19 disease without 
any particular treatments. They experience heterogeneous symptoms; a wide range 
of respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia. However, 
some others need urgent intervention and special treatment to get rid of this 
widespread disease. So far, there isn't any unique drug for the potential 
treatment of COVID 19. However, some available therapeutic drugs used for other 
diseases seem beneficial for the COVID-19 treatment. On the other hand, there is 
a robust global concern for developing an efficient COVID-19 vaccine to control 
the COVID-19 pandemic sustainably. According to the WHO report, since 8 October 
2021, 320 vaccines have been in progress. 194 vaccines are in the pre-clinical 
development stage that 126 of them are in clinical progression. Here, in this 
paper, we have comprehensively reviewed the most recent and updated information 
about coronavirus and its mutations, all the potential therapeutic approaches 
for treating COVID-19, developed diagnostic systems for COVID- 19 and the 
available COVID-19 vaccines and their mechanism of action.

The antigen-based rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) using saliva specimens is fast, 
noninvasive, and suitable for SARS-CoV-2 self-testing, unlike nasopharyngeal 
swab (NPS) testing. We evaluated a novel Beanguard gargle (BG)-based virus 
collection method that can be applied to Ag-RDT as an alternative to the current 
RT-PCR with an NPS for early diagnosis of COVID-19. This clinical trial 
comprised 102 COVID-19-positive patients hospitalized after a governmental 
screening process and 100 healthy individuals. Paired NPS and BG-based saliva 
specimens from COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals were analyzed using 
NPS-RT-PCR, BG-RT-PCR, and BG-Ag-RDTs, whose diagnostic performance for 
detecting SARS-CoV-2 was compared. BG-Ag-RDTs showed high sensitivity (97.8%) 
and specificity (100%) in 45 patients within 6 days of illness and detected all 
cases of SARS-CoV-2 Alpha and Delta variants. In 11 asymptomatic active COVID-19 
cases, both BG-Ag-RDTs and BG-RT-PCR showed sensitivities and specificities of 
100%. Sensitivities of BG-Ag-RDT and BG-RT-PCR toward salivary viral detection 
were highly concordant, with no discrimination between symptomatic (97.0%), 
asymptomatic (100%), or SARS-CoV-2 variant (100%) cases. The intermolecular 
interactions between SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and truncated canavalin, an 
active ingredient from the bean extract (BE), were observed in terms of 
physicochemical properties. The detachment of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding 
domain from hACE2 increased as the BE concentration increased, allowing the 
release of the virus from hACE2 for early diagnosis. Using BG-based saliva 
specimens remarkably enhances the Ag-RDT diagnostic performance as an 
alternative to NPS and enables noninvasive, rapid, and accurate COVID-19 
self-testing and mass screening, supporting efficient COVID-19 management. 
IMPORTANCE An Ag-RDT is less likely to be accepted as an initial test method for 
early diagnosis owing to its low sensitivity. However, our self-collection 
method, Ag-RDT using BG-based saliva specimens, showed significantly enhanced 
detection sensitivity and specificity toward SARS-CoV-2 including the Alpha and 
Delta variants in all patients tested within 6 days of illness. The method 
represents an attractive alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs for the early 
diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 cases. The evidence suggests 
that the method could have a potential for mass screening and monitoring of 
COVID-19 cases.

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID19), the novel respiratory illness caused by severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with severe 
morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study was to compare different 
immunoassays. We evaluated three immunochromatographic test (The 
StrongStep®SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM kit, AllTest COV-19 IgG/IgM kit, and Wondfo® 
SARS-CoV-2 Antibody) and two chemiluminescence immunoassays (CMIA) (Covid-19 
VIRCLIA® IgM+IgA/IgG monotest and the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay) in COVID-19 
patients. The assays were performed using serum samples of three group patients, 
i.e., healthy controls, patients with SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive, and patients with 
SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative clinically diagnosed of COVID-19 infection. The 
detection percentages of IgG with the StrongStep® SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM kit and 
AllTest COV-19 IgG/IgM kit were similar in both groups (83.3% and 80.6%, 
respectively in group 2, p = 0.766) and (42.9% and 50.0%, respectively in group 
3, p = 0.706). There were some differences on IgM detection between StrongStep® 
SARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM kit and AllTest COV-19 IgG/IgM kit (11.1% and 30.6%, 
respectively in group 2, p = 0.042 and 0.0% and 28.6%, respectively in group 3, 
p = 0.031). The positive rate of IgG in group 2 is higher compared to group 3 
with the two immunoassays tested. We observe the same positive rates of IgG with 
the two CMIA. Our study shows excellent performance of CMIA compared to 
immunochromatographic test and confirms its potential use in the diagnosis of 
the new SARS-CoV-2.

BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The safety and immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine in older adults with different frailty and 
disability profiles have not been well determined. Our objective was to analyze 
immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in older adults across 
frailty and disability profiles.
DESIGN: Multicenter longitudinal cohort study.
SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 134 residents aged ≥65 years with different 
frailty and disability profiles in five long-term care facilities (LTCFs) in 
Albacete, Spain.
INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: Residents were administered two vaccine doses as 
per the label, and antibody levels were determined 21.9 days (SD 9.3) after both 
the first and second dose. Functional variables were assessed using activities 
of daily living (Barthel Index), and frailty status was determined with the 
FRAIL instrument. Cognitive status and comorbidity were also evaluated.
RESULTS: Mean age was 82.9 years (range 65-99), and 71.6% were female. The mean 
antibody titers in residents with and without previous COVID-19 infection were 
49,878 AU/ml and 15,274 AU/ml, respectively (mean difference 34,604; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 27,699-41,509). No severe adverse reactions were 
observed, after either vaccine dose. Those with prevaccination COVID-19 had an 
increased antibody level after the vaccine (B = 31,337; 95% CI: 22,725-39,950; 
p < 0.001). Frailty, disability, older age, sex, cognitive impairment, or 
comorbidities were not associated with different antibody titers.
CONCLUSIONS: The BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in older adults is safe and 
produces immunogenicity, independently of the frailty and disability profiles. 
Older adults in LTCFs should receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

The pandemic causing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) has globally infected more than 50 million people and ∼1.2 million 
have succumbed to this deadly pathogen. With the vaccine trials still in 
clinical phases, mitigation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies 
primarily on robust virus detection methods and subsequent quarantine measures. 
Hence, the importance of rapid, affordable and reproducible virus testing will 
serve the need to identify and treat infected subjects in a timely manner. Based 
on the type of diagnostic assay, the primary targets are viral genome (RNA) and 
encoded proteins. Currently, COVID-19 detection is performed using various 
molecular platforms as well as serodiagnostics that exhibit approximately 71% 
sensitivity. These methods encounter several limitations including sensitivity, 
specificity, availability of skilled expertise and instrument access. 
Saliva-based COVID-19 diagnostics are emerging as a superior alternative to 
nasal swabs because of the ease of sample collection, no interaction during 
sampling, and high viral titers during early stages of infection. In addition, 
SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the environment as aerosols associated with suspended 
particulate matter. Designing virus detection strategies in diverse samples will 
allow timely monitoring of virus spread in humans and its persistence in the 
environment. With the passage of time, advanced technologies are overcoming 
limitations associated with detection. Enhanced sensitivity and specificity of 
next-generation diagnostics are key features enabling improved prognostic care. 
In this comprehensive review, we analyze currently adopted advanced technologies 
and their concurrent use in the development of diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 
detection.

The pandemic outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, with millions of infected patients 
worldwide, has severely challenged all aspects of public health. In this regard, 
early and rapid detection of infected cases and providing effective therapeutics 
against the virus are in urgent demand. Along with conventional clinical 
protocols, nanomaterial-based diagnostics and therapeutics hold a great 
potential against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Indeed, nanoparticles 
with their outstanding characteristics would render additional advantages to the 
current approaches for rapid and accurate diagnosis and also developing 
prophylactic vaccines or antiviral therapeutics. In this review, besides 
presenting an overview of the coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2, we discuss the 
introduced nanomaterial-based detection assays and devices and also antiviral 
formulations and vaccines for coronaviruses.

INTRODUCTION: In December 2019, the first COVID-19 case, caused by Severe Acute 
Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China. 
The SARS-CoV-2 rapidly disseminated throughout the world via community spread, 
acquiring pandemic status with significant fatality.
OBSERVATIONS: Rapid SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was soon perceived critical for 
arresting community spread and effective therapy development. Human SARS-CoV-2 
infection can be diagnosed either by nucleic acid identification or specific 
antibody detection. Contrary to nucleic acid identification confirmed active 
SARS-CoV-2 infection; antibody detection confirms a past infection, even in 
asymptomatic subjects. SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies augment the ability to 
effectively counter the virus. A crucial hurdle limiting the steadfast 
implementation of antibody detection is the time required for threshold B 
lymphocyte population generation. This process is dependent on precise antigen 
recognition and MHC class I molecules presentation.
CONCLUSIONS: Thus, nucleic acid and antibody dependent tests complement each 
other in identifying human SARS-CoV-2 infection and shaping up subsequent 
immunological responses. This article discusses the complimentary association of 
nucleic acid identification (corresponding to an active infection) and antibody 
testing (the yester CoV-2 infection vulnerability) as the diagnostic and 
screening measures of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Highlights Nucleic acid (RNA) 
identification and specific antibody detection against SARS-CoV-2 are the noted 
diagnostic mechanisms for screening human SARS-CoV-2 infection. While nucleic 
acid identification screens prevailing SARS-CoV-2 infection, detection of 
SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies signifies a past infection, even in asymptomatic 
subjects. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 provide a potential therapeutic option 
via transfer from antibody rich plasma of a recovered subject to an infected 
individual. Nucleic acid identification may not absolutely confirm the infection 
because of frequent SARS-CoV-2 genome mutations and possible technical errors, 
while specific antibody detection also needs at least (8-14) days for detectable 
screening of B-cell generated antibodies. Nucleic acid and antibody tests are 
complementary to each other as an early stage diagnostic assay for SARS-CoV-2 
infection and possible therapy (antibodies). Sufferers with a high clinical 
suspicion but negative RT-PCR screening could be examined via combined imaging 
and repeated swab test.

SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The spectrum of 
asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission presents 
challenges for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 test performance for diagnostic or 
screening purposes and for interpreting test results. Molecular and antigen 
tests can detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and are used to diagnose COVID-19. 
Clinicians should consider a test's characteristics, test timing in relation to 
symptom onset, and the pretest probability of disease when interpreting results. 
Molecular and antigen SARS-CoV-2 tests both have high specificity. However, 
antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity and thus greater potential for 
false-negative results. Pretest probability of disease should be based on a 
patient's exposure to someone with a confirmed or probable case, signs or 
symptoms of COVID-19, local or population-specific COVID-19 prevalence, and 
presence of an alternative diagnosis. Using a leaf plot is an efficient way to 
visualize posttest probability of disease based on estimated pretest probability 
and the test's sensitivity and specificity. A negative molecular or antigen test 
result might not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection when pretest probability is high, 
depending on the test's sensitivity. A symptom-based approach is preferred over 
a test-based approach for discontinuing isolation precautions for most patients 
with COVID-19 because prolonged shedding of viral RNA does not necessarily 
correlate with infectivity. Antibody tests might help identify past SARS-CoV-2 
infection if performed two to four weeks after symptom onset; however, because 
of uncertainty about the extent and durability of postinfection or 
vaccine-induced immunity, they should not yet be used to infer immunity or guide 
discontinuation of personal protective measures.

An outbreak of COVID-19, caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in 
December 2019, spread throughout the country and around the world, quickly. The 
primary detection technique for SARS-CoV-2, the reverse-transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based approach, requires expensive reagents and 
equipment and skilled personnel. In addition, for SARS-CoV-2 detection, 
specimens are usually shipped to a designated laboratory for testing, which may 
extend the diagnosis and treatment time of patients with COVID-19. The latest 
research shows that clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats 
(CRISPR)-based approaches can quickly provide visual, rapid, ultrasensitive, and 
specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 at isothermal conditions. Therefore, 
CRISPR-based approaches are expected to be developed as attractive alternatives 
to conventional RT-PCR methods for the efficient and accurate detection of 
SARS-CoV-2. Recent advances in the field of CRISPR-based biosensing technologies 
for SARS-CoV-2 detection and insights into their potential use in many 
applications are reviewed in this article.

The extraordinary global demand for reagents and diagnostic instruments needed 
for timely detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) infection has rapidly affected their availability. In order to meet 
diagnostic needs, it has been necessary to develop new diagnostic procedures. To 
date, molecular diagnostic tools have represented the gold standard for 
diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thus an alternative and real-time PCR 
system was required. To this aim, a molecular rapid test which works with direct 
real-time RT-PCR may be a relevant aid. In the present work, the accuracy, 
sensitivity, and specificity of the bKIT Virus Finder COVID-19 rapid molecular 
test by Hyris Ltd. was evaluated. Moreover, the influence of a different swab 
storage medium composition was examined relative to that of a routinely used 
comparator assay. The Hyris Ltd. assay showed an overall agreement of 100% with 
the comparator based on a panel consisting of 74 retrospective positive 
nasopharyngeal swabs (NPSs), collected either in universal transport medium 
(UTM) or using ESwab. No false-positive result was achieved on samples that 
previously tested negative. Cross-reactivity screening on microorganisms that 
commonly colonize the human upper respiratory tract was not detected, excluding 
the risk of false-positive results. Simultaneously, drugs frequently 
administered to cure respiratory diseases did not interfere with the analytical 
performance of the assay. Our results showed that the Hyris Ltd. bKIT Virus 
Finder COVID-19 is a reliable assay for rapid qualitative detection of 
SARS-CoV-2, providing the advantage of less complex and unambiguous 
interpretation of results. Indeed, skilled technicians are not required, and 
thus the Hyris system is suitable as a rapid and easy system for SARS-CoV-2 
diagnosis. IMPORTANCE In order to overcome the increased demand for diagnostic 
tools for the timely detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested the bKIT Virus 
Finder COVID-19 molecular rapid test by Hyris Ltd. The new system was confirmed 
as a reliable assay for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection, since sensitivity and 
specificity parameters were fully satisfied. Moreover, the bKIT Virus Finder 
COVID-19 provides the advantage of easy results interpretation, since skilled 
technicians are not required, and thus the Hyris system is a valuable SARS-CoV-2 
rapid diagnosis system.

Facing the unprecedented global public health crisis caused by coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19), nucleic acid tests for severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are the gold standard for diagnosing 
COVID-19. The asymptomatic carriers were not suspected of playing a significant 
role in the ongoing pandemic, and universal nucleic acid screening in close 
contacts of confirmed cases and asymptomatic carriers has been carried out in 
many medium- and high-risk areas for the spread of the virus. Recently, anal 
swabs for key population screening have been shown to not only reduce missed 
diagnoses but also facilitate the traceability of infectious sources. As a 
specimen for the detection of viruses, the goal of this paper is to briefly 
review the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 and the necessity of using anal 
swabs for SARS-CoV-2 screening to minimize transmission and a threat to other 
people with COVID-19.

In detecting infectious diseases, such as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), real-time 
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is one of the most 
important technologies for RNA detection and disease diagnosis. To achieve high 
quality assurance, appropriate positive and negative controls are critical for 
disease detection using RT-PCR kits. In this study, we have found that 
commercial kits often adopt DNAs instead of RNAs as the positive controls, which 
can't report the kit problems in reverse transcription, thereby increasing risk 
of the false negative results when testing patient samples. To face the 
challenge, we have proposed and developed the chemically modified RNAs, such as 
phosphoroselenaote and phosphorothioate RNAs (Se-RNA and S-RNA), as the 
controls. We have found that while demonstrating the high thermostability, 
biostability, chemostability and exclusivity (or specificity), both Se-RNA and 
S-RNA can be fine templates for reverse transcription, indicating their 
potentials as both positive and negative controls for RT-PCR kits.

The first local spread of COVID-19 in Israel was detected in March 2020. Due to 
the diversity in clinical presentations of COVID-19, diagnosis by RT-PCR alone 
might miss patients with mild or no symptoms. Serology testing may better 
evaluate the actual magnitude of the spread of infection in the population. This 
is the first nationwide seroprevalence study conducted in Israel. It is one of 
the most widespread to be conducted thus far, and the largest per-country 
population size. The survey was conducted between June 28 and September 14, 2020 
and included 54,357 patients who arrived at the Health Maintenance Organizations 
to undergo a blood test for any reason. A patient was considered seropositive 
after two consecutive positive results with two different kits (Abbott and 
DiaSorin).The overall seroprevalence was 3.8% (95%CI 3.7-4.0), males higher than 
females [4.9% (95%CI 4.6-5.2) vs. 3.1% (95%CI 2.9-3.3) respectively]. 
Adolescents had the highest prevalence [7.8% (95%CI 7.0-8.6)] compared to other 
age groups. Participants who had undergone RT-PCR testing had a tenfold higher 
risk to be seropositive. The prevalence-to-incidence ratio was 4.5-15.7. 
Serology testing is an important complimentary tool for assessing the actual 
magnitude of infection and thus essential for implementing policy measures to 
control the pandemic. A positive serology test result was recently accepted in 
Israel as being sufficient to define recovery, with possible far-reaching 
consequences, such as the deploying of employees to ensure the maintenance of a 
functional economy.
