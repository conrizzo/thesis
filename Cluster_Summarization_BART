Cluster Number 16 An effective vaccine is needed to halt the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. At least 120 SARS- covirus 2 vaccines are currently under development.
Cluster Number 17 A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has raised world concern since it emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019. An outbreak of respiratory illness proved to be infected by a 2019 novel coronAVirus, officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (CO VID-19), and has spread rapidly in China and to other parts of the world. More than 75,000 cases have been reported in 32 countries/regions, resulting in more than 2000 deaths worldwide.
Cluster Number 18 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cause china epidemics with high morbidity and mortality, the infection has been transmitted to other countries. 18 years ago, in 2002, the world was astonished by the appearance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.
Cluster Number 19 This study improves our understanding of immune response in humans after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The immune response to Sars-Cov-2 is critical in controlling disease, but there is concern that waning immunity may predispose to reinfection.
Cluster Number 20 SARS-CoV-2 infection related symptoms were detected in 35 of them and different degrees of radiological abnormalities were detected. The prevalence of bacterial infection in patients infected with SARS- cov-2 is not well understood. The authors sought to review and synthesize the available evidence on asymptomatic Sars-coV- 2 infection.
Cluster Number 21 Many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have underlying cardiovascular disease or develop acute cardiac injury during the course of the illness. In this cohort study of 416 consecutive patients with confirmed CO VID-19, cardiac injury occurred in 19.7% of patients during hospitalization, and it was one independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality. The prognosis of patients with underlying CVD but without myocardial injury was relatively favorable.
Cluster Number 22 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a newly emerging human infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, previously called 2019-nCoV) With more than 900 000 confirmed cases worldwide and nearly 50 000 deaths during the first 3 months of 2020, the coronav virus disease 2019 has emerged as an unprecedented health care crisis.
Cluster Number 23 Results: Overall, 112 hospitalised patients and 2001 nonhospitalised patients (confirmed COVID-19, n=345) were analysed. Sixty-nine patients were classified into severe and nonsevere groups to analyze their clinical and laboratory characteristics.
Cluster Number 24 An outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease (i.e., COVID-19) has been recorded in Wuhan, China since late December 2019, which subsequently became pandemic around the world. The new SARS-CoV-2 coronav virus, which causes the CO VID-19 disease, was reported in Wahuan, China, in December 2019.
